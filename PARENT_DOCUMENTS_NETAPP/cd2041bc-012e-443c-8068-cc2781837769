You must address the underlying\nissue immediately. Service disruption and loss of data might result if the issue is\nnot resolved.\nMajor: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current operations\nor approaching the threshold for a critical alert. You should investigate major\nalerts and address any underlying issues to ensure that the abnormal condition\ndoes not stop the normal operation of a StorageGRID node or service.\nMinor: The system is operating normally, but an abnormal condition exists\nthat could affect the system’s ability to operate if it continues. You should monitor\nand resolve minor alerts that don’t clear on their own to ensure they don’t result in\na more serious problem.</td>
