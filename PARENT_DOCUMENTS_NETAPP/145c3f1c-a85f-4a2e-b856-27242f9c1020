Has the system been upgraded recently? Was a hotfix applied?

Has any hardware been repaired or changed recently?

Has the ILM policy been updated?

Has the client workload changed?

Has the client application or its behavior changed?

Have you changed load balancers, or added or removed a high availability group of Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes?

Have any tasks been started that might take a long time to complete? Examples include:

Recovery of a failed Storage Node â—¦ Storage Node decommissioning

Have any changes been made to user authentication, such as adding a tenant or changing LDAP configuration?

Is data migration taking place?

Were platform services recently enabled or changed?

Was compliance enabled recently?

Have Cloud Storage Pools been added or removed? Have any changes been made to storage compression or encryption?

Have there been any changes to the network infrastructure? For example, VLANs, routers, or DNS.

Establish baselines

You can establish baselines for your system by recording the normal levels of various operational values. In the future, you can compare current values to these baselines to help detect and resolve abnormal values. Property

How to obtain

Average storage consumption

GB consumed/day

Go to the Grid Manager. On the Nodes page, select the entire grid or a site and go to the Storage tab.

Percent consumed/day

On the Storage Used - Object Data chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate how much storage is consumed each day

You can collect this information for the entire system or for a specific data center. Average metadata consumption

GB consumed/day

Go to the Grid Manager. On the Nodes page, select the entire grid or a site and go to the Storage tab.

Percent consumed/day

On the Storage Used - Object Metadata chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate how much metadata storage is consumed each day

You can collect this information for the entire system or for a specific data center. Rate of S3/Swift operations

Operations/second

On the Grid Manager dashboard, select Performance > S3 operations or Performance > Swift operations.

To see ingest and retrieval rates and counts for a specific site or node, select NODES > site or Storage Node > Objects. Position your cursor over the Ingest and Retrieve chart for S3 or Swift. Failed S3/Swift operations Operations

Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. On the Overview tab in the API Operations section, view the value for S3 Operations - Failed or Swift Operations - Failed.

ILM evaluation rate

Objects/second

From the Nodes page, select grid > ILM.

On the ILM Queue chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate a baseline value for Evaluation rate for your system.
