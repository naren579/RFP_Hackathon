Node procedures

Node procedures: Overview

You might need to perform maintenance procedures related to specific grid nodes or node services.

Server Manager procedures

Server Manager runs on every grid node to supervise the starting and stopping of services and to ensure that services gracefully join and leave the StorageGRID system. Server Manager also monitors the services on every grid node and will automatically attempt to restart any services that report faults.

To perform Server Manager procedures, you typically need to access the node’s command line.

You should access Server Manager only if technical support has directed you to do so.
