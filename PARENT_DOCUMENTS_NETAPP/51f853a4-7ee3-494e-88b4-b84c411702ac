Until the object is transitioned to a non-retrievable state, the value for expiry-date is set to some distant time in the future. The exact time of transition is not controlled by the StorageGRID system.

State of object

Object ingested into StorageGRID but not yet evaluated by ILM, or object stored in a traditional storage pool or using erasure coding

Object in Cloud Storage Pool but not yet transitioned to a non-retrievable state

Object has transitioned to non-retrievable state, but at least one copy also exists on the grid

Object transitioned to a non-retrievable state, and no copy exists on the grid

Object in process of being restored from a non- retrievable state

Response to HeadObject

200 OK (No special response header is returned.)

The value for expiry-date is set to some distant time in the future.

Note: If the copy on the grid is not available (for example, a Storage Node is down), you must issue a RestoreObject request to restore the copy from the Cloud Storage Pool before you can successfully retrieve the object.

The expiry-date indicates when the object in the Cloud Storage Pool will be returned to a non- retrievable state.

Multipart or segmented objects in Cloud Storage Pool

If you uploaded a multipart object or if StorageGRID split a large object into segments, StorageGRID determines whether the object is available in the Cloud Storage Pool by sampling a subset of the object’s parts or segments. In some cases, a HeadObject request might incorrectly return `x-amz-restore: ongoing- request="false" when some parts of the object have already been transitioned to a non-retrievable state or when some parts of the object have not yet been restored. HeadObject and cross-grid replication

If you are using grid federation and cross-grid replication is enabled for a bucket, the S3 client can verify an object’s replication status by issuing a HeadObject request. The response includes the StorageGRID-specific x-ntap-sg-cgr-replication-status response header, which will have one of the following values: Grid

Replication status

Source

SUCCESS: The replication was successful.

PENDING: The object hasn’t been replicated yet.

FAILURE: The replication failed with a permanent failure. A user must resolve the error.

Destination

REPLICA: The object was replicated from the source grid.

StorageGRID does not support the x-amz-replication-status header. PutObject

You can use the S3 PutObject request to add an object to a bucket. Resolve conflicts

Conflicting client requests, such as two clients writing to the same key, are resolved on a "latest-wins" basis. The timing for the "latest-wins" evaluation is based on when the StorageGRID system completes a given request, and not on when S3 clients begin an operation.

Object size

The maximum recommended size for a single PutObject operation is 5 GiB (5,368,709,120 bytes). If you have objects that are larger than 5 GiB, use multipart upload instead.

The maximum supported size for a single PutObject operation is 5 TiB (5,497,558,138,880 bytes). Replication status
