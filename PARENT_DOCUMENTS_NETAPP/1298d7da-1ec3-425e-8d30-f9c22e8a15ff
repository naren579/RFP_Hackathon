Start or restart service

You might need to start a service that has been stopped, or you might need to stop and restart a service.

Before you begin

You have the Passwords.txt file. Steps

1. Log in to the grid node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Decide which command to issue, based on whether the service is currently running or stopped.

If the service is currently stopped, use the start command to start the service manually: service servicename start For example:

service ldr start

If the service is currently running, use the restart command to stop the service and then restart it: service servicename restart

For example:

service ldr restart

Using the restart command is the same as using the stop command followed by the start command. You can issue restart even if the service is currently stopped.

3. Log out of the command shell: exit

Use a DoNotStart file

If you are performing various maintenance or configuration procedures under the direction of technical support, you might be asked to use a DoNotStart file to prevent services from starting when Server Manager is started or restarted.
