GNRG: GNDS Registration

The CMN service generates this audit message when a service has updated or registered information about itself in the StorageGRID system. Code

Field

Description

RSLT

Result

The result of the update request:

SUCS: Successful

SUNV: Service Unavailable

GERR: Other failure

GNID

Node ID

The node ID of the service that initiated the update request.

GNTP

Device Type

The grid node’s device type (for example, BLDR for an LDR service).

1352

Code

Field

Description GNDV

Device Model version

The string identifying the grid node’s device model version in the DMDL bundle.

GNGP

Group

The group to which the grid node belongs (in the context of link costs and service-query ranking).

GNIA

IP Address

This message is generated whenever a grid node updates its entry in the Grid Nodes Bundle. GNUR: GNDS Unregistration

The CMN service generates this audit message when a service has unregistered information about itself from the StorageGRID system.

Code

Field

Description

RSLT

Result

The result of the update request:

SUCS: Successful

SUNV: Service Unavailable

GERR: Other failure

GNID Node ID

The node ID of the service that initiated the update request.

GTED: Grid Task Ended

This audit message indicates that the CMN service has finished processing the specified grid task and has moved the task to the Historical table. If the result is SUCS, ABRT, or ROLF, there will be a corresponding Grid Task Started audit message. The other results indicate that processing of this grid task never started. Code

Field

Description

TSID

Task ID

This field uniquely identifies a generated grid task and allows the grid task to be managed over its lifecycle.

Note: The Task ID is assigned at the time that a grid task is generated, not the time that it is submitted. It is possible for a given grid task to be submitted multiple times, and in this case the Task ID field is not sufficient to uniquely link the Submitted, Started, and Ended audit messages. The CMN service generates this audit message when a service has unregistered information about itself from the StorageGRID system.
