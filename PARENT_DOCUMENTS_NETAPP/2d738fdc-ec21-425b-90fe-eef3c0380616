Optimize an Archive Node for TSM middleware sessions

You can optimize the performance of an Archive Node that connects to Tivoli Server Manager (TSM) by configuring the Archive Node’s sessions.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. About this task

Typically, the number of concurrent sessions that the Archive Node has open to the TSM middleware server is set to the number of tape drives the TSM server has dedicated to the Archive Node. One tape drive is allocated for storage while the rest are allocated for retrieval. However, in situations where a Storage Node is being rebuilt from Archive Node copies or the Archive Node is operating in Read-only mode, you can optimize TSM server performance by setting the maximum number of retrieve sessions to be the same as number of concurrent sessions. The result is that all drives can be used concurrently for retrieval, and, at most, one of these drives can also be used for storage if applicable. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Target.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Change Maximum Retrieve Sessions to be the same as Number of Sessions.

Configure the archive state and counters for TSM

If your Archive Node connects to a TSM middleware server, you can configure an Archive Node’s archive store state to Online or Offline. You can also disable the archive store when the Archive Node first starts up, or reset the failure count being tracked for the associated alarm.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Store.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Modify the following settings, as necessary:

Store State: Set the component state to either:

▪ Online: The Archive Node is available to process object data for storage to the archival storage system.

▪ Offline: The Archive Node is not available to process object data for storage to the archival storage system.

Archive Store Disabled on Startup: When selected, the Archive Store component remains in the Read- only state when restarted. Used to persistently disable storage to the targeted the archival storage system. Useful when the targeted archival storage system is unable to accept content.

Reset Store Failure Count: Reset the counter for store failures. This can be used to clear the ARVF (Stores Failure) alarm.

Manage an Archive Node when TSM server reaches capacity

The TSM server has no way to notify the Archive Node when either the TSM database or the archival media storage managed by the TSM server is nearing capacity. This situation can be avoided through proactive monitoring of the TSM server.

The Archive Node continues to accept object data for transfer to the TSM server after the TSM server stops accepting new content. This content can’t be written to media managed by the TSM server. An alarm is triggered if this happens.
