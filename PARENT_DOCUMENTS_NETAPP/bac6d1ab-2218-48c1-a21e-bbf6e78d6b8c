There are four types of graphs:

Grafana charts: Shown on the Nodes page, Grafana charts are used to plot the values of Prometheus metrics over time. For example, the NODES > Network tab for a Storage Node includes a Grafana chart for network traffic. 1209

Grafana charts are also included on the pre-constructed dashboards available from the SUPPORT > Tools > Metrics page.

Line graphs: Available from the Nodes page and from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page after a data value), line graphs are used to plot the values of StorageGRID

1210

Area graphs: Available from the Nodes page and from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page after a data value), area graphs are used to plot volumetric attribute quantities, (select the chart icon such as object counts or service load values. Area graphs are similar to line graphs, but include a light brown shading below the line. The changes in the value are plotted in regular data intervals (bins) over time.

Some graphs are denoted with a different type of chart icon

and have a different format:

1211 State graph: Available from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page (select the chart icon data value), state graphs are used to plot attribute values that represent distinct states such as a service state that can be online, standby, or offline. State graphs are similar to line graphs, but the transition is discontinuous; that is, the value jumps from one state value to another.

The lines and colors used to draw charts have specific meaning.

Example Meaning

Reported attribute values are plotted using dark green lines.

Light green shading around dark green lines indicates that the actual values in that time range vary and have been "binned" for faster plotting. The dark line represents the weighted average. The range in light green indicates the maximum and minimum values within the bin. Light brown shading is used for area graphs to indicate volumetric data.

Blank areas (no data plotted) indicate that the attribute values were unavailable. The background can be blue, gray, or a mixture of gray and blue, depending on the state of the service reporting the attribute.

Light blue shading indicates that some or all of the attribute values at that time were indeterminate; the attribute was not reporting values because the service was in an unknown state.

Gray shading indicates that some or all of the attribute values at that time were not known because the service reporting the attributes was administratively down. A mixture of gray and blue shading indicates that some of the attribute values at the time were indeterminate (because the service was in an unknown state), while others were not known because the service reporting the attributes was administratively down.

Display charts and graphs

The Nodes page contains the charts and graphs you should access regularly to monitor attributes such as storage capacity and throughput. In some cases, especially when working with technical support, you can use the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page to access additional charts.

Before you begin

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser. Steps

1. Select NODES. Then, select a node, a site, or the entire grid.

2. Select the tab for which you want to view information.
