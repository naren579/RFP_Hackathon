Description

CNID

Connection Identifier

The unique identifier of the node-to-node session/connection.

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block being transferred. CTDR

Transfer Direction

Indicates if the CBID transfer was push-initiated or pull-initiated:

PUSH: The transfer operation was requested by the sending entity.

PULL: The transfer operation was requested by the receiving entity.

CTSR

Source Entity

The node ID of the source (sender) of the CBID transfer. CTDS

Destination Entity

The node ID of the destination (receiver) of the CBID transfer.

CTSS

Start Sequence Count

Indicates the sequence count on which the transfer started.

CTAS

Actual End Sequence Count

Indicates the last sequence count successfully transferred. If the Actual End Sequence Count is the same as the Start Sequence Count, and the Transfer Result was not successful, no data was exchanged.

Field

Description RSLT

Transfer Result

The result of the transfer operation (from the perspective of the sending entity):

SUCS: Transfer successfully completed; all requested sequence counts were sent.

CONL: connection lost during transfer

CTMO: connection timed-out during establishment or transfer

UNRE: destination node ID unreachable

CRPT: transfer ended due to reception of corrupt or invalid data

This audit message means a node-to-node data transfer operation was completed. If the Transfer Result was successful, the operation transferred data from "Start Sequence Count" to "Actual End Sequence Count". Sending and receiving nodes are identified by their node IDs. This information can be used to track system data flow and to locate, tabulate, and analyze errors. When combined with storage audit messages, it can also be used to verify replica counts. CGRR: Cross-Grid Replication Request

This message is generated when StorageGRID attempts a cross-grid replication operation to replicate objects between buckets in a grid federation connection.

Code

Field

Description

CSIZ

Object Size

The size of the object in bytes.

The CSIZ attribute was introduced in StorageGRID 11.8. As a result, cross-grid replication requests spanning a StorageGRID 11.7 to 11.8 upgrade might have an inaccurate total object size. S3AI

S3 tenant account ID

The ID of the tenant account that owns the bucket from which the object is being replicated.

GFID

Grid federation connection ID

The ID of the grid federation connection being used for cross-grid replication.

OPER

CGR operation

The type of cross-grid replication operation that was attempted:

0 = Replicate object

1 = Replicate multipart object

2 = Replicate delete marker S3BK

S3 bucket

The S3 bucket name.

S3KY

S3 Key

The S3 key name, not including the bucket name.

1349

Code

Field

Description

VSID

Version ID

The version ID of the specific version of an object that was being replicated.

RSLT

Result Code

Returns successful (SUCS) or general error (GERR). EBDL: Empty Bucket Delete

The ILM scanner deleted an object in a bucket that is deleting all objects (performing an empty bucket operation).

Code

Field

Description

CSIZ

Object Size

The size of the object in bytes.

PATH

S3 Bucket/Key

The S3 bucket name and S3 key name.

SEGC

Container UUID UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available The ID of the tenant account that owns the bucket from which the object is being replicated.

GFID

Grid federation connection ID

The ID of the grid federation connection being used for cross-grid replication.

OPER

CGR operation

The type of cross-grid replication operation that was attempted:

0 = Replicate object

1 = Replicate multipart object

2 = Replicate delete marker S3BK

S3 bucket

The S3 bucket name.

S3KY

S3 Key

The S3 key name, not including the bucket name.

Code

Field

Description

VSID

Version ID

The version ID of the specific version of an object that was being replicated.

RSLT

Result Code

Returns successful (SUCS) or general error (GERR). EBDL: Empty Bucket Delete

The ILM scanner deleted an object in a bucket that is deleting all objects (performing an empty bucket operation).

Code

Field

Description

CSIZ

Object Size

The size of the object in bytes.

PATH

S3 Bucket/Key

The S3 bucket name and S3 key name.

SEGC

Container UUID UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only if the object is segmented. UUID

Universally Unique Identifier

The identifier of the object within the StorageGRID system.

RSLT

Result of the delete operation

The result of event, process, or transaction. If is not relevant for a message, NONE is used rather than SUCS so that the message is not accidentally filtered.

EBKR: Empty Bucket Request

This message indicates a user sent a request to turn empty bucket on or off (that is, to delete bucket objects or to stop deleting objects). Code

Field

Description

BUID

Bucket UUID

The bucket ID.
