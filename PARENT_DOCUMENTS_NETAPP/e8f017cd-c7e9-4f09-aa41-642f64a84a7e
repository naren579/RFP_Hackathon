2. Select View buckets from the dashboard, or select STORAGE (S3) > Buckets.

3. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

4. Select the Cross-grid replication tab.

5. Select Test connection.

If the connection is healthy, a success banner appears. Otherwise, an error message appears, which you and the grid admin can use to resolve the issue. For details, see Troubleshoot grid federation errors.

6. If cross-grid replication is configured to occur in both directions, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and select Test connection to verify that cross-grid replication is working in the other direction. Disable cross-grid replication

You can permanently stop cross-grid replication if you no longer want to copy objects to the other grid.

Before disabling cross-grid replication, note the following:

Disabling cross-grid replication does not remove any objects that have already been copied between grids. For example, objects in my-bucket on Grid 1 that have been copied to my-bucket on Grid 2 aren’t removed if you disable cross-grid replication for that bucket. If you want to delete these objects, you must remove them manually.

If cross-grid replication was enabled for each of the buckets (that is, if replication occurs in both directions), you can disable cross-grid replication for either or both buckets. For example, you might want to disable replicating objects from my-bucket on Grid 1 to my-bucket on Grid 2, while continuing to replicate objects from my-bucket on Grid 2 to my-bucket on Grid 1. You must disable cross-grid replication before you can remove a tenant’s permission to use the grid federation connection. See Manage permitted tenants.

If you disable cross-grid replication for a bucket that contains objects, you will not be able to reenable cross-grid replication unless you delete all objects from both the source and destination buckets.

You can’t reenable replication unless both buckets are empty.

After a few moments, a success message appears. New objects added to this bucket can no longer be automatically replicated to the other grid. Cross-grid replication is no longer shown as a Enabled feature on the Buckets page. If you disable cross-grid replication for a bucket that contains objects, you will not be able to reenable cross-grid replication unless you delete all objects from both the source and destination buckets.

You can’t reenable replication unless both buckets are empty.
