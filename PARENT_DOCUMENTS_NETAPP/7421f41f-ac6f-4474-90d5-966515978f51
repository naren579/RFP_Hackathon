If\ncounts do go up, there might be a problem with the\nStorage Node’s underlying storage. A copy of\nerasure-coded object data is not considered missing\nuntil such time that the number of lost or corrupt\nfragments breaches the erasure code’s fault\ntolerance; therefore, it is possible to have corrupt\nfragment and to still be able to retrieve the object.\nIf the problem persists, contact technical support.</td>
