The username for an existing USM user can’t be changed. If you need to change a username, you must remove the user and create a new one.

If you add or remove a user’s authoritative engine ID and that user is currently selected for a destination, you must edit or remove the destination. Otherwise, a validation error occurs when you save the SNMP agent configuration.

8. When you have updated the SNMP agent configuration, select Save. Access MIB files

MIB files contain definitions and information about the properties of managed resources and services for the nodes in your grid. You can access MIB files that define the objects and notifications for StorageGRID. These files can be useful for monitoring your grid.

See Use SNMP monitoring for more information about SNMP and MIB files. Access MIB files

Follow these steps to access the MIB files.

Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Monitoring > SNMP agent.

2. On the SNMP agent page, select the file you want to download:

NETAPP-STORAGEGRID-MIB.txt: Defines the alert table and notifications (traps) accessible on all Admin Nodes.

ES-NETAPP-06-MIB.mib: Defines objects and notifications for E-Series-based appliances. ◦ MIB_1_10.zip: Defines objects and notifications for appliances with a BMC interface.

You can also access MIB files at the following location on any StorageGRID node: /usr/share/snmp/mibs

3. To extract the StorageGRID OIDs from the MIB file:

a. Get the OID of the root of the StorageGRID MIB:

root@user-adm1:~ # snmptranslate -On -IR storagegrid

Result: .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.28669 (28669 is always the OID for StorageGRID)

b. Grep for the StorageGRID OID in the entire tree (using paste to join lines):

root@user-adm1:~ # snmptranslate -Tso | paste -d " " - - | grep 28669 The snmptranslate command has many options that are useful for exploring the MIB. This command is available on any StorageGRID node.
