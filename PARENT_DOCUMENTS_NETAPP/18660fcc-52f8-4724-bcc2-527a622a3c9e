If an\nalert rule is silenced, you might not detect an underlying problem until it\nprevents a critical operation from completing. However, you might need to use\nan extended silence if an alert is triggered by a specific, intentional\nconfiguration, such as might be the case for the Services appliance link\ndown alerts and the Storage appliance link down alerts.</td>
