View a specific tenant

You can view details for a specific tenant. Steps

1. Select the tenant name from the Tenants page.

The tenant details page appears.

2. Review the tenant overview at the top of the page.

This section of the details page provides summary information for the tenant, including the tenant’s object count, quota utilization, logical space used, and quota setting.

3. From the Space breakdown tab, review the Space consumption chart.

This chart shows the total space consumption for all of the tenant’s S3 buckets (or Swift containers).

If a quota was set for this tenant, the amount of quota used and remaining is displayed in text (for example, 85.00 GB of 100 GB used). If no quota was set, the tenant has an unlimited quota, and the text includes only an amount of space used (for example, 85.00 GB used). The bar chart shows the percentage of quota in each bucket or container. If the tenant has exceeded the storage quota by more than 1% and by at least 1 GB, the chart shows the total quota and the excess amount. 1069

You can place your cursor over the bar chart to see the storage used by each bucket or container. You can place your cursor over the free space segment to see the amount of storage quota remaining.

Quota utilization is based on internal estimates and might be exceeded in some cases. For example, StorageGRID checks the quota when a tenant starts uploading objects and rejects new ingests if the tenant has exceeded the quota. However, StorageGRID does not take into account the size of the current upload when determining if the quota has been exceeded. If objects are deleted, a tenant might be temporarily prevented from uploading new objects until the quota utilization is recalculated. Quota utilization calculations can take 10 minutes or longer. A tenant’s quota utilization indicates the total amount of object data the tenant has uploaded to StorageGRID (logical size). The quota utilization does not represent the space used to store copies of those objects and their metadata (physical size).

You can enable the Tenant quota usage high alert rule to determine if tenants are consuming their quotas. If enabled, this alert is triggered when a tenant has used 90% of its quota. For instructions, see Edit alert rules.

4. From the Space breakdown tab, review the Bucket details.

This table lists the S3 buckets (or Swift containers) for the tenant. Space used is the total amount of object data in the bucket or container. This value does not represent the storage space required for ILM copies and object metadata.

5. Optionally, select Export to CSV to view and export a .csv file containing the usage values for each bucket or container.

The contents of an individual S3 tenant’s .csv file look like the following example: You can open the .csv file in a spreadsheet application or use it in automation.

6. Optionally, select the Allowed features tab to see a list of the permissions and features that are enabled for the tenant. See Edit tenant account if you need to change any of these settings.

7. If the tenant has the Use grid federation connection permission, optionally select the Grid federation tab to learn more about the connection.

See What is grid federation? and Manage the permitted tenants for grid federation.
