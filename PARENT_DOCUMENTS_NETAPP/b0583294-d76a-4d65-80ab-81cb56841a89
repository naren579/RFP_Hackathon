Redistributes data among all Storage Nodes at a site. It does not redistribute data within storage volumes.

Does not consider the replicated data usage on each Storage Node when determining where to move erasure-coded data.

Redistributes erasure-coded data evenly between Storage Nodes without considering the relative capacities of each node.

Will not distribute erasure-coded data to Storage Nodes that are more than 80% full.

Might decrease the performance of ILM operations and S3 and Swift client operations when it runs—additional resources are required to redistribute the erasure-coding fragments.

When the EC rebalance procedure is complete:

Erasure-coded data will have moved from Storage Nodes with less available space to Storage Nodes with more available space. The data protection of erasure-coded objects will be unchanged.

• Used (%) values might be different between Storage Nodes for two reasons:

Replicated object copies will continue to consume space on the existing nodes—the EC rebalance procedure does not move replicated data.

Larger-capacity nodes will be relatively less full than smaller-capacity nodes, even though all nodes will end up with approximately the same amount of erasure-coded data.

For example, suppose three 200-TB nodes are each filled to 80% (200 × 0.8 = 160 TB on each node, or 480 TB for the site). If you add a 400-TB node and run the rebalance procedure, all nodes will now have approximately the same amount of erasure-code data (480/4 = 120 TB). However, the Used (%) for the larger node will be less than the Used (%) for the smaller nodes.

When to rebalance erasure-coded data

Consider the following scenario: Might decrease the performance of ILM operations and S3 and Swift client operations when it runs—additional resources are required to redistribute the erasure-coding fragments.

When to rebalance erasure-coded data

Consider the following scenario:

StorageGRID is running at a single site, which contains three Storage Nodes. The ILM policy uses a 2+1 erasure-coding rule for all objects larger than 1.0 MB and a 2-copy replication rule for smaller objects.

All Storage Nodes have become completely full. The Low Object Storage alert has been triggered at the major severity level.

Rebalance is not required if you add enough nodes

To understand when EC rebalance is not required, suppose you added three (or more) new Storage Nodes. In this case, you don’t need to perform EC rebalance. The original Storage Nodes will remain full, but new objects

will now use the three new nodes for 2+1 erasure coding—the two data fragments and the one parity fragment can each be stored on a different node.

While you can run the EC rebalance procedure in this case, moving the existing erasure-coded data will temporarily decrease the grid’s performance, which might impact client operations.

Rebalance is required if you can’t add enough nodes To understand when EC rebalance is required, suppose you can only add two Storage Nodes, instead of three. Because the 2+1 scheme requires at least three Storage Nodes to have space available, the empty nodes can’t be used for new erasure-coded data.

To make use of the new Storage Nodes, you should run the EC rebalance procedure. When this procedure runs, StorageGRID redistributes existing erasure-coded data and parity fragments among all Storage Nodes at the site. In this example, when the EC rebalance procedure is complete, all five nodes are now only 60% full, and objects can continue to be ingested into the 2+1 erasure-coding scheme on all Storage Nodes.

Recommendations for EC rebalancing

NetApp requires EC rebalancing if all of the following statements are true:

You use erasure coding for your object data.
