If you are recovering a grid node, you must enter the name of the node you are recovering.

b. Use the Temporary installation password drop-down to specify a temporary installation password, so

that you can access the VM console or use SSH before the new node joins the grid.

The temporary installation password is only used during node installation. After a node has been added to the grid, you can access it using the node console password, which is listed in the Passwords.txt file in the Recovery Package.

▪ Use node name: The value you provided for the Node name field is used as the temporary installation password.

▪ Use custom password: A custom password is used as the temporary installation password. ▪ Disable password: No temporary installation password will be used. If you need to access the VM

to debug installation issues, see Troubleshoot installation issues.

c. If you selected Use custom password, specify the temporary installation password you want to use in the Custom password field.

d. In the Grid Network (eth0) section, select STATIC or DHCP for the Grid network IP configuration.

▪ If you select STATIC, enter the Grid network IP, Grid network mask, Grid network gateway, and

Grid network MTU.

▪ If you select DHCP, the Grid network IP, Grid network mask, and Grid network gateway are

automatically assigned.

e. In the Primary Admin IP field, enter the IP address of the primary Admin Node for the Grid Network.

This step does not apply if the node you are deploying is the primary Admin Node.

If you omit the primary Admin Node IP address, the IP address will be automatically discovered if the primary Admin Node, or at least one other grid node with ADMIN_IP configured, is present on the same subnet. However, it is recommended to set the primary Admin Node IP address here.

f. In the Admin Network (eth1) section, select STATIC, DHCP, or DISABLED for the Admin network IP configuration.

▪ If you don’t want to use the Admin Network, select DISABLED and enter 0.0.0.0 for the Admin

Network IP. You can leave the other fields blank.

▪ If you select STATIC, enter the Admin network IP, Admin network mask, Admin network

gateway, and Admin network MTU.

▪ If you select STATIC, enter the Admin network external subnet list. You must also configure a gateway.

▪ If you select DHCP, the Admin network IP, Admin network mask, and Admin network gateway

are automatically assigned.

g. In the Client Network (eth2) section, select STATIC, DHCP, or DISABLED for the Client network IP

configuration.

▪ If you don’t want to use the Client Network, select DISABLED and enter 0.0.0.0 for the Client

Network IP. You can leave the other fields blank.

▪ If you select STATIC, enter the Client network IP, Client network mask, Client network gateway, and Client network MTU.

▪ If you select DHCP, the Client network IP, Client network mask, and Client network gateway

are automatically assigned.

8. Review the virtual machine configuration and make any changes necessary.

9. When you are ready to complete, select Finish to start the upload of the virtual machine.

10.

If you deployed this node as part of recovery operation and this is not a full-node recovery, perform these

steps after deployment is complete: a. Right-click the virtual machine, and select Edit Settings.

b. Select each default virtual hard disk that has been designated for storage, and select Remove.

230

c. Depending on your data recovery circumstances, add new virtual disks according to your storage

requirements, reattach any virtual hard disks preserved from the previously removed failed grid node, or both.

Note the following important guidelines:

▪ If you are adding new disks you should use the same type of storage device that was in use before node recovery. configuration.

▪ If you don’t want to use the Client Network, select DISABLED and enter 0.0.0.0 for the Client

Network IP. You can leave the other fields blank.

▪ If you select STATIC, enter the Client network IP, Client network mask, Client network gateway, and Client network MTU.

▪ If you select DHCP, the Client network IP, Client network mask, and Client network gateway

are automatically assigned.
