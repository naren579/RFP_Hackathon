2. If possible, ensure that the system is running normally and that all grid nodes are connected to the grid.

Connected nodes have green check marks on the Nodes page.

3. Check for and resolve any current alerts, if possible.

4. Ensure no other maintenance procedures are in progress, such as an upgrade, recovery, expansion, or decommission procedure.

You should wait for any active maintenance procedures to complete before applying a hotfix.

You can’t apply a StorageGRID hotfix when another maintenance procedure is running. For example, you can’t apply a hotfix while a decommission, expansion, or recovery procedure is running.

If a node or site decommission procedure is paused, you can safely apply a hotfix. In addition, you might be able to apply a hotfix during the final stages of a StorageGRID upgrade procedure. See the instructions for upgrading StorageGRID software. Apply hotfix
