Each type of security certificate is described below, with links to the implementation instructions.

Management interface certificate

396

Certificate type

Description

Server

Authenticates the connection between client web browsers and the StorageGRID management interface, allowing users to access the Grid Manager and Tenant Manager without security warnings. This certificate also authenticates Grid Management API and Tenant Management API connections.

You can use the default certificate created during installation or upload a custom certificate.

S3 and Swift API certificate

Certificate type

Description

Server

Authenticates secure S3 or Swift client connections to a Storage Node and to load balancer endpoints (optional). Grid CA certificate

See the Default Grid CA certificate description.

Certificate type

Description Server

Authenticates the connection between S3 or Swift clients and the StorageGRID Load Balancer service on Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes. You can upload or generate a load balancer certificate when you configure a load balancer endpoint. Client applications use the load balancer certificate when connecting to StorageGRID to save and retrieve object data.

You can also use a custom version of the global S3 and Swift API certificate certificate to authenticate connections to the Load Balancer service. If the global certificate is used to authenticate load balancer connections, you donâ€™t need to upload or generate a separate certificate for each load balancer endpoint.

Note: The certificate used for load balancer authentication is the most used certificate during normal StorageGRID operation. Cloud Storage Pool endpoint certificate

399

Certificate type

Description

Server

Authenticates the connection from a StorageGRID Cloud Storage Pool to an external storage location, such as S3 Glacier or Microsoft Azure Blob storage. A different certificate is required for each cloud provider type. Email alert notification certificate

Certificate type

Description

Server and client

Authenticates the connection between an SMTP email server and StorageGRID that is used for alert notifications.

If communications with the SMTP server requires Transport Layer Security (TLS), you must specify the email server CA certificate.
