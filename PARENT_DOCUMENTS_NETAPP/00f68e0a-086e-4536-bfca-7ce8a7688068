2. Run the following command to ensure the deployment is proceeding:

sudo storagegrid node status node-name

3. If any node returns a status of "Not Running" or "Stopped," run the following command: sudo storagegrid node start node-name

4. If you have previously enabled and started the StorageGRID host service (or if you are unsure if the service has been enabled and started), also run the following command:

sudo systemctl reload-or-restart storagegrid

Configure grid and complete installation (Ubuntu or Debian) Navigate to the Grid Manager

You use the Grid Manager to define all of the information required to configure your StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

The primary Admin Node must be deployed and have completed the initial startup sequence.

Steps

1. Open your web browser and navigate to one of the following addresses: https://primary_admin_node_ip

client_network_ip

Alternatively, you can access the Grid Manager on port 8443:

https://primary_admin_node_ip:8443

You can use the IP address for the primary Admin Node IP on the Grid Network or on the Admin Network, as appropriate for your network configuration.

2. Select Install a StorageGRID system.

The page used to configure a StorageGRID system appears.

Specify Grid Network subnets

You must specify the subnets that are used on the Grid Network.

About this task

The subnet entries include the subnets for the Grid Network for each site in your StorageGRID system, along with any subnets that need to be reachable through the Grid Network.

If you have multiple grid subnets, the Grid Network gateway is required. All grid subnets specified must be reachable through this gateway. Steps

1. Specify the CIDR network address for at least one Grid Network in the Subnet 1 text box.

2. Click the plus sign next to the last entry to add an additional network entry.

If you have already deployed at least one node, click Discover Grid Networks Subnets to automatically populate the Grid Network Subnet List with the subnets reported by grid nodes that have registered with the Grid Manager.
