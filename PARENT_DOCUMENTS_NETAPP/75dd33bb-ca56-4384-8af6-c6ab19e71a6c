Requirements and considerations for single sign-on

Use a tenant account Use sandbox mode

You can use sandbox mode to configure and test single sign-on (SSO) before enabling it for all StorageGRID users. After SSO has been enabled, you can return to sandbox mode whenever you need to change or retest the configuration.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Root access permission.

You have configured identity federation for your StorageGRID system.

Azure About this task

When SSO is enabled and a user attempts to sign in to an Admin Node, StorageGRID sends an authentication request to the SSO identity provider. In turn, the SSO identity provider sends an authentication response back to StorageGRID, indicating whether the authentication request was successful. For successful requests:

The response from Active Directory or PingFederate includes a universally unique identifier (UUID) for the user.

The response from Azure includes a User Principal Name (UPN). Manage admin groups

The response from Active Directory or PingFederate includes a universally unique identifier (UUID) for the user.

The response from Azure includes a User Principal Name (UPN).

To allow StorageGRID (the service provider) and the SSO identity provider to communicate securely about user authentication requests, you must configure certain settings in StorageGRID. Next, you must use the SSO identity provider’s software to create a relying party trust (AD FS), Enterprise Application (Azure) or Service Provider (PingFederate) for each Admin Node. Finally, you must return to StorageGRID to enable SSO. Sandbox mode makes it easy to perform this back-and-forth configuration and to test all of your settings before you enable SSO. When you are using sandbox mode, users can’t sign in using SSO.

Access sandbox mode

Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Access control > Single sign-on.

The Single Sign-on page appears, with the Disabled option selected.
