3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each node on the host.

4. If you have a Linux host: a. Log in to the host operating system.

b. Stop the node: storagegrid node stop c. Shut down the host operating system.

5. If the node is running on a VMware virtual machine or it is an appliance node, issue the shutdown command: shutdown -h now

Perform this step regardless of the outcome of the service servermanager stop command.

After you issue the shutdown -h now command on an appliance node, you must power cycle the appliance to restart the node.

For the appliance, this command shuts down the controller, but the appliance is still powered on. You must complete the next step.

6. If you are powering down an appliance node, follow the steps for your appliance.

Power off and on all nodes in grid

You might need to shut down your entire StorageGRID system, for example, if you are moving a data center. These steps provide a high-level overview of the recommended sequence for performing a controlled shutdown and startup.

When you power off all nodes in a site or grid, you will not be able to access ingested objects while the Storage Nodes are offline.

Power off and on all nodes in grid

You might need to shut down your entire StorageGRID system, for example, if you are moving a data center. These steps provide a high-level overview of the recommended sequence for performing a controlled shutdown and startup.

When you power off all nodes in a site or grid, you will not be able to access ingested objects while the Storage Nodes are offline.

Stop services and shut down grid nodes

Before you can power off a StorageGRID system, you must stop all services running on each grid node, and then shut down all VMware virtual machines, container engines, and StorageGRID appliances. About this task

Stop services on Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes first, and then stop services on Storage Nodes.

This approach allows you to use the primary Admin Node to monitor the status of the other grid nodes for as long as possible.

If a single host includes more than one grid node, donâ€™t shut down the host until you have stopped all of the nodes on that host. If the host includes the primary Admin Node, shut down that host last.
