Storage pool

On one or more Storage Nodes or Archive Nodes within StorageGRID.

An ILM rule in the active ILM policies. Replication or erasure coding.

Multiple.

Objects are quickly accessible at any time.

Cloud Storage Pool

In an Amazon S3 bucket, Azure Blob storage container, or Google Cloud that is external to the StorageGRID system.

If the Cloud Storage Pool is an Amazon S3 bucket:

You can optionally configure a bucket lifecycle to transition objects to low-cost, long-term storage, such as Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive. The external storage system must support the Glacier storage class and the S3 RestoreObject API.

You can create Cloud Storage Pools for use with AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S), which supports the AWS Secret Region. Using the ILM > Storage pools option in Grid Manager.

If the Cloud Storage Pool is an Azure Blob storage container, StorageGRID transitions the object to the Archive tier.

Note: In general, don’t configure Azure Blob storage lifecycle management for the container used for a Cloud Storage Pool. RestoreObject operations on objects in the Cloud Storage Pool can be affected by the configured lifecycle. An ILM rule in the active ILM policies.

Replication.

One copy in the Cloud Storage Pool and, optionally, one or more copies in StorageGRID.

Note: You can’t store an object in more than one Cloud Storage Pool at any given time.

Low-cost storage.

Note: FabricPool data can’t be tiered to Cloud Storage Pools. Objects with S3 Object Lock enabled can’t be placed in Cloud Storage Pools.

Lifecycle of a Cloud Storage Pool object

Before implementing Cloud Storage Pools, review the lifecycle of objects that are stored in each type of Cloud Storage Pool. S3: Lifecycle of a Cloud Storage Pool object

The steps describe the lifecycle stages of an object that is stored in an S3 Cloud Storage Pool.

"Glacier" refers to both the Glacier storage class and the Glacier Deep Archive storage class, with one exception: the Glacier Deep Archive storage class does not support the Expedited restore tier. Only Bulk or Standard retrieval is supported.

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) supports object retrieval from long-term storage without requiring a POST Restore operation.

1. Object stored in StorageGRID

To start the lifecycle, a client application stores an object in StorageGRID.

2. Object moved to S3 Cloud Storage Pool

When the object is matched by an ILM rule that uses an S3 Cloud Storage Pool as its placement location, StorageGRID moves the object to the external S3 bucket specified by the Cloud Storage Pool. When the object has been moved to the S3 Cloud Storage Pool, the client application can retrieve it using an S3 GetObject request from StorageGRID, unless the object has been transitioned to Glacier storage.

3. Object transitioned to Glacier (non-retrievable state)

Optionally, the object can be transitioned to Glacier storage. For example, the external S3 bucket might use lifecycle configuration to transition an object to Glacier storage immediately or after some number of days.
