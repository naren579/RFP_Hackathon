      <td>Audit messages, security event logs, and application logs are not sent\nto Admin Nodes. Instead, they are saved only on the nodes that\ngenerated them ("the local node"). The audit information generated on\nevery local node is stored in /var/local/log/localaudit.log\nNote: StorageGRID periodically removes local logs in a rotation to\nfree up space. When the log file for a node reaches 1 GB, the existing\nfile is saved, and a new log file is started. The rotation limit for the log\nis 21 files. When the 22nd version of the log file is created, the oldest\nlog file is deleted. On average about 20 GB of log data is stored on\neach node.</td>
