storagegrid_ntp_locked

The node is not locked to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. storagegrid_s3_data_transfers_bytes_ingested

The total amount of data ingested from S3 clients to this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset.

storagegrid_s3_data_transfers_bytes_retrieved

The total amount of data retrieved by S3 clients from this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset. storagegrid_s3_operations_failed

The total number of failed S3 operations (HTTP status codes 4xx and 5xx), excluding those caused by S3 authorization failure.

storagegrid_s3_operations_successful

The total number of successful S3 operations (HTTP status code 2xx).

1117

storagegrid_s3_operations_unauthorized The percentage of available CPU time currently being used by this service. Indicates how busy the service is. The amount of available CPU time depends on the number of CPUs for the server. storagegrid_ntp_chosen_time_source_offset_milliseconds

Systematic offset of time provided by a chosen time source. Offset is introduced when the delay to reach a time source is not equal to the time required for the time source to reach the NTP client.

storagegrid_s3_operations_successful

The total number of successful S3 operations (HTTP status code 2xx).

1117

storagegrid_s3_operations_unauthorized

The total number of failed S3 operations that are the result of an authorization failure. storagegrid_servercertificate_management_interface_cert_expiry_days

The number of days before the Management Interface certificate expires.

storagegrid_servercertificate_storage_api_endpoints_cert_expiry_days

1118

storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes

An estimate of the total size of replicated and erasure-coded object data on the Storage Node. storagegrid_storage_utilization_metadata_allowed_bytes

The total space on volume 0 of each Storage Node that is allowed for object metadata. This value is always less than the actual space reserved for metadata on a node, because a portion of the reserved space is required for essential database operations (such as compaction and repair) and future hardware and software upgrades.The allowed space for object metadata controls overall object capacity. storagegrid_storage_utilization_metadata_bytes

The amount of object metadata on storage volume 0, in bytes.

storagegrid_storage_utilization_total_space_bytes

The total amount of storage space allocated to all object stores.

storagegrid_storage_utilization_usable_space_bytes

The total amount of object storage space remaining. Calculated by adding together the amount of available space for all object stores on the Storage Node. storagegrid_swift_data_transfers_bytes_ingested

The total amount of data ingested from Swift clients to this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset.

storagegrid_swift_data_transfers_bytes_retrieved

The total amount of data retrieved by Swift clients from this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset. storagegrid_swift_operations_failed An estimate of the total size of replicated and erasure-coded object data on the Storage Node. storagegrid_storage_utilization_metadata_allowed_bytes
