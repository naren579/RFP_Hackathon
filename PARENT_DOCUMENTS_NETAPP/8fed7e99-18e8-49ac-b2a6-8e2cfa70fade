Required tasks Create a tenant account for each client protocol (Swift or S3) that will be used to store objects on your StorageGRID system.

Control system access by configuring groups and user accounts. Optionally, you can configure a federated identity source (such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP), so you can import administration groups and users. Or, you can create local groups and users.

Integrate and test the S3 API or Swift API client applications you will use to upload objects to your StorageGRID system.

Configure the information lifecycle management (ILM) rules and ILM policy you want to use to protect object data.

If your installation includes appliance Storage Nodes, use SANtricity OS to complete the following tasks:

Connect to each StorageGRID appliance. ◦ Verify receipt of AutoSupport data. See Set up hardware.

Review and follow the StorageGRID system hardening guidelines to eliminate security risks.

Configure email notifications for system alerts.

If your StorageGRID system includes any Archive Nodes (deprecated), configure the Archive Node’s connection to the target external archival storage system. Optional tasks

Update grid node IP addresses if they have changed since you planned your deployment and generated the Recovery Package.

Configure storage encryption, if required.

Configure storage compression to reduce the size of stored objects, if required.

Troubleshoot installation issues

If any problems occur while installing your StorageGRID system, you can access the installation log files. Technical support might also need to use the installation log files to resolve issues.

The following installation log files are available from the container that is running each node:

/var/local/log/install.log (found on all grid nodes)

/var/local/log/gdu-server.log (found on the primary Admin Node)

The following installation log files are available from the host:

/var/log/storagegrid/daemon.log

199

• /var/log/storagegrid/nodes/<node-name>.log

To learn how to access the log files, see Collect log files and system data.

Example /etc/network/interfaces

The /etc/network/interfaces file includes three sections, which define the physical interfaces, bond interface, and VLAN interfaces. You can combine the three example sections into a single file, which will aggregate four Linux physical interfaces into a single LACP bond and then establish three VLAN interfaces subtending the bond for use as StorageGRID Grid, Admin, and Client Network interfaces. Physical interfaces

Note that the switches at the other ends of the links must also treat the four ports as a single LACP trunk or port channel, and must pass at least the three referenced VLANs with tags.
