RSCC The time limit in seconds within which a health check test must complete in order for a storage volume to be considered healthy. Only change this value when directed to do so by Support. Description

Resets the count of Missing Objects Detected (OMIS). Use only after object existence check completes. Missing replicated object data is restored automatically by the StorageGRID system.

Set the rate at which background verification takes place. See information about configuring the background verification rate.

Description

Reset the counter for corrupt replicated object data found during background verification. This option can be used to clear the Corrupt Objects Detected (OCOR) alarm condition.

Delete corrupt objects from the quarantine directory, reset the count of quarantined objects to zero, and clear the Quarantined Objects Detected (OQRT) alarm. This option is used after corrupt objects have been automatically restored by the StorageGRID system.

If a Lost Objects alarm is triggered, technical support might want to access the quarantined objects. In some cases, quarantined objects might be useful for data recovery or for debugging the underlying issues that caused the corrupt object copies. Description

Reset the counter for write failures of erasure-coded object data to the Storage Node.

Reset the counter for read failures of erasure-coded object data from the Storage Node.

Reset the counter for delete failures of erasure-coded object data from the Storage Node.

Reset the counter for the number of corrupt copies of erasure-coded object data on the Storage Node.

Reset the counter for corrupt fragments of erasure- coded object data on the Storage Node.

Reset the counter for missing fragments of erasure- coded object data on the Storage Node. Use only after object existence check completes.

Description Reset Inbound Replication Failure Count

RICR

Reset the counter for inbound replication failures. This can be used to clear the RIRF (Inbound Replication — Failed) alarm.

Reset Outbound Replication Failure Count

ROCR

Reset the counter for outbound replication failures. This can be used to clear the RORF (Outbound Replications — Failed) alarm. Disable Inbound Replication

DSIR

Select to disable inbound replication as part of a maintenance or testing procedure. Leave unchecked during normal operation.

When inbound replication is disabled, objects can be retrieved from the Storage Node for copying to other locations in the StorageGRID system, but objects can’t be copied to this Storage Node from other locations: the LDR service is read-only. Disable Outbound Replication

DSOR

Select to disable outbound replication (including content requests for HTTP retrievals) as part of a maintenance or testing procedure. Leave unchecked during normal operation.

When outbound replication is disabled, objects can be copied to this Storage Node, but objects can’t be retrieved from the Storage Node to be copied to other locations in the StorageGRID system. The LDR service is write-only. Manage full Storage Nodes

As Storage Nodes reach capacity, you must expand the StorageGRID system through the addition of new storage. There are three options available: adding storage volumes, adding storage expansion shelves, and adding Storage Nodes.

Add storage volumes

Each Storage Node supports a maximum number of storage volumes. The defined maximum varies by platform. If a Storage Node contains fewer than the maximum number of storage volumes, you can add volumes to increase its capacity. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system. Add storage expansion shelves

Some StorageGRID appliance Storage Nodes, such as the SG6060 or SG6160, can support additional storage shelves. If you have StorageGRID appliances with expansion capabilities that have not already been expanded to maximum capacity, you can add storage shelves to increase capacity. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system.
