      <td>The results will vary based on the versioning\nstate of the source and destination buckets\n(which don’t need to be the same):\n• If both buckets are versioned, a delete\nrequest will add a delete marker in both\nlocations.\n• If only the source bucket is versioned, a\ndelete request will add a delete marker to\nthe source but not to the destination.\n• If neither bucket is versioned, a delete\nrequest will delete the object from the\nsource but not from the destination.\nSimilarly, objects in the destination bucket can\nbe deleted without affecting the source.</td>
