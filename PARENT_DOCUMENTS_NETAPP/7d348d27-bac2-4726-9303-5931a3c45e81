How do I get these values?

Depending on your requirements, you can do either of the following to obtain the information you need:

Use the FabricPool setup wizard. The FabricPool setup wizard helps you to quickly configure the required values in StorageGRID and outputs a file that you can use to configure ONTAP System Manager. The wizard guides you through the required steps and helps to make sure your settings conform to StorageGRID and FabricPool best practices.

Configure each item manually. Then, enter the values into ONTAP System Manager or the ONTAP CLI. Follow these steps:

1. Configure a high availability (HA) group for FabricPool.

2. Create a load balancer endpoint for FabricPool.

3. Create a tenant account for FabricPool.

4. Sign in to the tenant account, and create the bucket and access keys for the root user.

5. Create an ILM rule for FabricPool data and add it to your active ILM policies. See Configure ILM for FabricPool data. 6. Optionally, create a traffic classification policy for FabricPool.

Use FabricPool setup wizard: Considerations and requirements

You can use the FabricPool setup wizard to configure StorageGRID as the object storage system for a FabricPool cloud tier. After you complete the setup wizard, you can enter the required details into ONTAP System Manager.

When to use the FabricPool setup wizard

The FabricPool setup wizard guides you through each step of configuring StorageGRID for use with FabricPool and automatically configures certain entities for you, such as the ILM and traffic classification policies. As part of completing the wizard, you download a file that you can use to enter values into ONTAP System Manager. Use the wizard to configure your system more quickly and to make sure your settings conform to StorageGRID and FabricPool best practices. Assuming you have Root access permission, you can complete the FabricPool setup wizard when you start using the StorageGRID Grid Manager, or you can access and complete the wizard at any later time. Depending on your requirements, you can also configure some or all of the required items manually and then use the wizard to assemble the values that ONTAP needs into a single file.

Use the FabricPool setup wizard unless you know you have special requirements or your implementation will require significant customization.

Before using the wizard

Confirm you have completed these prerequisite steps. Review best practices

You have a general understanding of the information needed to attach StorageGRID as a cloud tier.

You have reviewed the FabricPool best practices for:

High availability (HA) groups ◦ Load balancing ◦ ILM rules and policy

Obtain IP addresses and set up VLAN interfaces When to use the FabricPool setup wizard
