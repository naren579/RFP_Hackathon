Traffic classification policies are identified by their ID. Policy IDs are listed on the Traffic classification policies page.

7. Analyze the graphs to determine how often the policy is limiting traffic and whether you need to adjust the policy.

Supported ciphers for outgoing TLS connections

The StorageGRID system supports a limited set of cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections to the external systems used for identity federation and Cloud Storage Pools. Supported versions of TLS

StorageGRID supports TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 for connections to external systems used for identity federation and Cloud Storage Pools.

The TLS ciphers that are supported for use with external systems have been selected to ensure compatibility with a range of external systems. The list is larger than the list of ciphers that are supported for use with S3 or Swift client applications. To configure ciphers, go to CONFIGURATION > Security > Security settings and select TLS and SSH policies.

TLS configuration options such as protocol versions, ciphers, key exchange algorithms, and MAC algorithms aren’t configurable in StorageGRID. Contact your NetApp account representative if you have specific requests about these settings. Benefits of active, idle, and concurrent HTTP connections

How you configure HTTP connections can impact the performance of the StorageGRID system. Configurations differ depending on whether the HTTP connection is active or idle or you have concurrent multiple connections.

You can identify the performance benefits for the following types of HTTP connections:

Idle HTTP connections

526

• Active HTTP connections

Concurrent HTTP connections

Benefits of keeping idle HTTP connections open

You should keep HTTP connections open even when client applications are idle to allow client applications to perform subsequent transactions over the open connection. Based on system measurements and integration experience, you should keep an idle HTTP connection open for a maximum of 10 minutes. StorageGRID might automatically close an HTTP connection that is kept open and idle for longer than 10 minutes.

Open and idle HTTP connections provide the following benefits: Reduced latency from the time that the StorageGRID system determines it has to perform an HTTP transaction to the time that the StorageGRID system can perform the transaction

Reduced latency is the main advantage, especially for the amount of time required to establish TCP/IP and TLS connections.

Increased data transfer rate by priming the TCP/IP slow-start algorithm with previously performed transfers

Instantaneous notification of several classes of fault conditions that interrupt connectivity between the client application and the StorageGRID system

Determining how long to keep an idle connection open is a trade‐off between the benefits of slow start that is associated with the existing connection and the ideal allocation of the connection to internal system resources. Benefits of active HTTP connections

For connections directly to Storage Nodes, you should limit the duration of an active HTTP connection to a maximum of 10 minutes, even if the HTTP connection continuously performs transactions.

Determining the maximum duration that a connection should be held open is a trade‐off between the benefits of connection persistence and the ideal allocation of the connection to internal system resources.
