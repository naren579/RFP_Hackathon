7. If the tenant has the Use grid federation connection permission, optionally select the Grid federation tab to learn more about the connection.

See What is grid federation? and Manage the permitted tenants for grid federation.

View network traffic

If traffic classification policies are in place for a tenant, review the network traffic for that tenant. Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Network > Traffic classification.

The Traffic Classification Policies page appears, and the existing policies are listed in the table.

2. Review the list of policies to identify the ones that apply to a specific tenant.

3. To view metrics associated with a policy, select the radio button to the left of the policy, and select Metrics.

4. Analyze the graphs to determine how often the policy is limiting traffic and whether you need to adjust the policy. See Manage traffic classification policies for more information.

Use the audit log

Optionally, you can use the audit log for more granular monitoring of a tenantâ€™s activities.

For instance, you can monitor the following types of information:

Specific client operations, such as PUT, GET, or DELETE

Object sizes

The ILM rule applied to objects

The source IP of client requests

Audit logs are written to text files that you can analyze using your choice of log analysis tool. This allows you to better understand client activities, or to implement sophisticated chargeback and billing models.

See Review audit logs for more information. Use Prometheus metrics

Optionally, use Prometheus metrics to report on tenant activity.

In the Grid Manager, select SUPPORT > Tools > Metrics. You can use existing dashboards, such as S3 Overview, to review client activities.

The tools available on the Metrics page are primarily intended for use by technical support. Some features and menu items within these tools are intentionally non-functional.

From the top of the Grid Manager, select the help icon and select API documentation. You can use the metrics in the Metrics section of the Grid Management API to create custom alert rules and dashboards for tenant activity.

See Review support metrics for more information. Monitor S3 and Swift client operations

You can monitor object ingest and retrieval rates as well as metrics for object counts, queries, and verification. You can view the number of successful and failed attempts by

client applications to read, write, and modify objects in the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser. Steps

1. From the dashboard, select the Performance tab.

2. Refer to the S3 and Swift charts, which summarize the number of client operations performed by Storage Nodes and the number of API requests received by Storage Nodes during the selected time frame.

3. Select NODES to access the Nodes page.

4. From the Nodes home page (grid level), select the Objects tab.

The chart shows S3 and Swift ingest and retrieve rates for your entire StorageGRID system in bytes per second and the amount of data ingested or retrieved. You can select a time interval or apply a custom interval.

5. To see information for a particular Storage Node, select the node from the list on the left, and select the Objects tab.

The chart shows the ingest and retrieve rates for the node. The tab also includes metrics for object counts, metadata queries, and verification operations.

1072 Monitor load balancing operations

If you are using a load balancer to manage client connections to StorageGRID, you should monitor load balancing operations after you configure the system initially and after you make any configuration changes or perform an expansion.
