# vi /var/local/gpt-data/specs/grid.xml

Admin Nodes use the ADC service during the authentication process.

12. From the Admin Node, log in to each of the ADC Storage Nodes, using the IP addresses you identified.

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

14. Repeat steps Use Lumberjack to collect logs and Review logs to review the logs on the Storage Nodes.

15. If you are unable to resolve the issue, contact technical support.

Provide the logs you collected to technical support. See also Log files reference. User interface issues

The user interface for the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager might not respond as expected after StorageGRID software is upgraded.

Steps

1. Make sure you are using a supported web browser.

Browser support can change with each StorageGRID release. Confirm you are using browser that is supported by your StorageGRID version.

2. Clear your web browser cache.

Clearing the cache removes outdated resources used by the previous version of StorageGRID software, and permits the user interface to operate correctly again. For instructions, see the documentation for your web browser.
