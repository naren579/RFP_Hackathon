      <td>By default, an alarm is triggered when object\nidentifiers can’t be allocated because ADC quorum\ncan’t be reached.\nIdentifier block allocation on the CMN service requires\na quorum (50% + 1) of the ADC services to be online\nand connected. If quorum is unavailable, the CMN\nservice is unable to allocate new identifier blocks until\nADC quorum is reestablished. If ADC quorum is lost,\nthere is generally no immediate impact on the\nStorageGRID system (clients can still ingest and\nretrieve content), as approximately one month’s\nsupply of identifiers are cached elsewhere in the grid;\nhowever, if the condition continues, the StorageGRID\nsystem will lose the ability to ingest new content.\nIf an alarm is triggered, investigate the reason for the\nloss of ADC quorum (for example, it can be a network\nor Storage Node failure) and take corrective action.\nIf the problem persists, contact technical support.</td>
