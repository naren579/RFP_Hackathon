If you change the storage class, new object data is stored with the new storage class. Existing object continue to be stored under the storage class set when ingested.

Bucket Name, Region, and Endpoint, use AWS values and can’t be changed.

5. Select Apply Changes. Modify the Cloud Tiering Service state

You can control the Archive Node’s ability read and write to the targeted external archival storage system that connects through the S3 API by changing the state of the Cloud Tiering Service.

Before you begin

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

The Archive Node must be configured. About this task

You can effectively take the Archive Node offline by changing the Cloud Tiering Service State to Read-Write Disabled.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Select a Cloud Tiering Service State.

5. Select Apply Changes. Reset the Store Failure Count for S3 API connection

If your Archive Node connects to an archival storage system through the S3 API, you can reset the Store Failure Count, which can be used to clear the ARVF (Store Failures) alarm.

Migrate objects from Cloud Tiering - S3 to a Cloud Storage Pool

If you are currently using the Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3) feature to tier object data to an S3 bucket, you should migrate your objects to a Cloud Storage Pool instead. Cloud Storage Pools provide a scalable approach that takes advantage of all of the Storage Nodes in your StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

You have already stored objects in the S3 bucket configured for Cloud Tiering.

Before migrating object data, contact your NetApp account representative to understand and manage any associated costs. About this task

From an ILM perspective, a Cloud Storage Pool is similar to a storage pool. However, while storage pools consist of Storage Nodes or Archive Nodes within the StorageGRID system, a Cloud Storage Pool consists of an external S3 bucket.

Before migrating objects from Cloud Tiering - S3 to a Cloud Storage Pool, you must first create an S3 bucket and then create the Cloud Storage Pool in StorageGRID. Then, you can create a new ILM policy and replace the ILM rule used to store objects in the Cloud Tiering bucket with a cloned ILM rule that stores the same objects in the Cloud Storage Pool. When objects are stored in a Cloud Storage Pool, copies of those objects can’t also be stored within StorageGRID. If the ILM rule you are currently using for Cloud Tiering is configured to store objects in multiple locations at the same time, consider whether you still want to perform this optional migration because you will lose that functionality. If you continue with this migration, you must create new rules instead of cloning the existing ones. Steps

1. Create a Cloud Storage Pool.

Use a new S3 bucket for the Cloud Storage Pool to ensure it contains only the data managed by the Cloud Storage Pool.

2. Locate any ILM rules in the active ILM policies that cause objects to be stored in the Cloud Tiering bucket.

3. Clone each of these rules.

4. In the cloned rules, change the placement location to the new Cloud Storage Pool.
