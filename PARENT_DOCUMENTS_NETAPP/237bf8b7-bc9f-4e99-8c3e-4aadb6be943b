Some StorageGRID appliance Storage Nodes, such as the SG6060 or SG6160, can support additional storage shelves. If you have StorageGRID appliances with expansion capabilities that have not already been expanded to maximum capacity, you can add storage shelves to increase capacity. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system.

Add Storage Nodes DSOR

Select to disable outbound replication (including content requests for HTTP retrievals) as part of a maintenance or testing procedure. Leave unchecked during normal operation.

When outbound replication is disabled, objects can be copied to this Storage Node, but objects can’t be retrieved from the Storage Node to be copied to other locations in the StorageGRID system. The LDR service is write-only. Manage full Storage Nodes

As Storage Nodes reach capacity, you must expand the StorageGRID system through the addition of new storage. There are three options available: adding storage volumes, adding storage expansion shelves, and adding Storage Nodes.

Add storage volumes

Each Storage Node supports a maximum number of storage volumes. The defined maximum varies by platform. If a Storage Node contains fewer than the maximum number of storage volumes, you can add volumes to increase its capacity. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system. Add storage expansion shelves

Some StorageGRID appliance Storage Nodes, such as the SG6060 or SG6160, can support additional storage shelves. If you have StorageGRID appliances with expansion capabilities that have not already been expanded to maximum capacity, you can add storage shelves to increase capacity. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system.

Add Storage Nodes

You can increase storage capacity by adding Storage Nodes. Careful consideration of currently active ILM rules and capacity requirements must be taken when adding storage. See the instructions for expanding a StorageGRID system. Manage Admin Nodes

Use multiple Admin Nodes

A StorageGRID system can include multiple Admin Nodes to enable you to continuously monitor and configure your StorageGRID system even if one Admin Node fails.

If an Admin Node becomes unavailable, attribute processing continues, alerts and alarms (legacy system) are still triggered, and email notifications and AutoSupport packages are still sent. However, having multiple Admin Nodes does not provide failover protection except for notifications and AutoSupport packages. In particular, alarm acknowledgments made from one Admin Node aren’t copied to other Admin Nodes.

There are two options for continuing to view and configure the StorageGRID system if an Admin Node fails:

Web clients can reconnect to any other available Admin Node.

If a system administrator has configured a high availability group of Admin Nodes, web clients can continue

564 to access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager using the virtual IP address of the HA group. See Manage high availability groups.

When using an HA group, access is interrupted if the active Admin Node fails. Users must sign in again after the virtual IP address of the HA group fails over to another Admin Node in the group.

Some maintenance tasks can only be performed using the primary Admin Node. If the primary Admin Node fails, it must be recovered before the StorageGRID system is fully functional again. Identify the primary Admin Node

The primary Admin Node hosts the CMN service. Some maintenance procedures can only be performed using the primary Admin Node.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select site > Admin Node, and then select on this Admin Node.

2. Select site > Admin Node, and then select on this Admin Node.

The primary Admin Node hosts the CMN service.

3. If this Admin Node does not host the CMN service, check the other Admin Nodes. View notification status and queues

The Network Management System (NMS) service on Admin Nodes sends notifications to the mail server. You can view the current status of the NMS service and the size of its notifications queue on the Interface Engine page.

To access the Interface Engine page, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Finally, select site > Admin Node > NMS > Interface Engine.
