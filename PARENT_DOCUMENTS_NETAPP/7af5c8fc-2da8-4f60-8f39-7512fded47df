Configure StorageGRID to send security events to an external syslog server. If using syslog export, select TLS and RELP/TLS for the transport protocols.

See the Log files reference for more information about StorageGRID logs. See Audit messages for more information about StorageGRID audit messages. NetApp AutoSupport

The AutoSupport feature of StorageGRID allows you to proactively monitor the health of your system and automatically send packages to the NetApp Support Site, your organization’s internal support team, or a support partner. By default, sending AutoSupport packages to NetApp is enabled when StorageGRID is configured for the first time.

The AutoSupport feature can be disabled. However, NetApp recommends enabling it because AutoSupport helps speed problem identification and resolution should an issue arise on your StorageGRID system.

AutoSupport supports HTTPS, HTTP, and SMTP for transport protocols. Because of the sensitive nature of AutoSupport packages, NetApp strongly recommends using HTTPS as the default transport protocol for sending AutoSupport packages to NetApp. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

You can configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for an S3 bucket if you want that bucket and objects in that bucket to be accessible to web applications in other domains. In general, don’t enable CORS unless it is required. If CORS is required, restrict it to trusted origins.

See the steps for configuring cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). External security devices

A complete hardening solution must address security mechanisms outside of StorageGRID. Using additional infrastructure devices for filtering and limiting access to StorageGRID is an effective way to establish and maintain a stringent security posture. These external security devices include firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), and other security devices.

A third-party load balancer is recommended for untrusted client traffic. Third-party load balancing offers more control and additional layers of protection against attack. Ransomware mitigation

Help protect your object data from ransomware attacks by following the recommendations in Ransomware defense with StorageGRID.
