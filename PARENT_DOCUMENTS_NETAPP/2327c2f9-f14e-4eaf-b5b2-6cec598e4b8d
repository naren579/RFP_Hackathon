3. In the Node Progress section of the page, monitor the progress of the decommission procedure as nodes are removed.

When a Storage Node is removed, each node goes through a series of stages. Although most of these stages occur quickly or even imperceptibly, you might need to wait days or even weeks for other stages to complete, based on how much data needs to moved. Additional time is required to manage erasure-coded data and re-evaluate ILM. 1474

4. After all nodes have reached the Complete stage, wait for the remaining site decommission operations to complete.

During the Repair Cassandra step, StorageGRID makes any necessary repairs to the Cassandra clusters that remain in your grid. These repairs might take several days or more, depending on how many Storage Nodes remain in your grid.

During the Deactivate EC Profiles & Delete Storage Pools step, the following ILM changes are made:

▪ Any erasure-coding profiles that referred to the site are deactivated. ▪ Any Storage Pools that referred to the site are deleted.

The All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier) is also removed because it uses the All Sites site.

Finally, during the Remove Configuration step, any remaining references to the site and its nodes are removed from the rest of the grid.

Complete these tasks after you complete the site decommission procedure:

Ensure that the drives of all Storage Nodes in the decommissioned site are wiped clean. Use a commercially available data wiping tool or service to permanently and securely remove data from the drives.

If the site included one or more Admin Nodes and single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, remove all relying party trusts for the site from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

After the nodes have been gracefully powered off automatically as part of the connected site decommission procedure, remove the associated virtual machines. Rename grid, site, or node

Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview

As required, you can change the display names that are shown throughout the Grid Manager for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can update display names safely and whenever you need.

What is the rename procedure?

When you install StorageGRID initially, you specify a name for the grid, each site, and each node. These initial

names are known as system names, and they are the names initially shown throughout StorageGRID. 1476
