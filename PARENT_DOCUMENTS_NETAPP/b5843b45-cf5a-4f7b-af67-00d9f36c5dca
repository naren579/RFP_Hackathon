Example: S3 object deletion

When an S3 client deletes an object from a Storage Node (LDR service), an audit message is generated and saved to the audit log.

Not all audit messages generated during a delete transaction are listed in the example below. Only those related to the S3 delete transaction (SDEL) are listed. SDEL: S3 Delete

Object deletion begins when the client sends a DeleteObject request to an LDR service. The message contains the bucket from which to delete the object and the object’s S3 Key, which is used to identify the object.
