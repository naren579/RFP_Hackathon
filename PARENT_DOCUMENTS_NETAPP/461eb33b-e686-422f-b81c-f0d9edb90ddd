Troubleshoot StorageGRID system

Troubleshoot a StorageGRID system: Overview

If you encounter a problem when using a StorageGRID system, refer to the tips and guidelines in this section for help in determining and resolving the issue.

Often, you can resolve problems on your own; however, you might need to escalate some issues to technical support. Define the problem

The first step to solving a problem is to define the problem clearly.

This table provides examples of the types of information that you might collect to define a problem:

Question Example response

What is the StorageGRID system doing or not doing? What are its symptoms?

Client applications are reporting that objects can’t be ingested into StorageGRID.

When did the problem start?

Object ingest was first denied at about 14:50 on January 8, 2020.

How did you first notice the problem?

Notified by client application. Also received alert email notifications.

Does the problem happen consistently, or only sometimes?

Problem is ongoing.

If the problem happens regularly, what steps cause it to occur

Problem happens every time a client tries to ingest an object.

Question

Example response

If the problem happens intermittently, when does it occur? Record the times of each incident that you are aware of.

Problem is not intermittent.

Have you seen this problem before? How often have you had this problem in the past?

This is the first time I have seen this issue. Assess the risk and impact on the system

After you have defined the problem, assess its risk and impact on the StorageGRID system. For example, the presence of critical alerts does not necessarily mean that the system is not delivering core services.

This table summarizes the impact the example problem is having on system operations: Question

Example response

Can the StorageGRID system ingest content?

No.

Can client applications retrieve content?

Some objects can be retrieved and others can’t.

Is data at risk?

No.

Is the ability to conduct business severely affected?

Yes, because client applications can’t store objects to the StorageGRID system and data can’t be retrieved consistently. Collect data

After you have defined the problem and have assessed its risk and impact, collect data for analysis. The type of data that is most useful to collect depends upon the nature of the problem.

Type of data to collect Why collect this data

Instructions

Create timeline of recent changes

Changes to your StorageGRID system, its configuration, or its environment can cause new behavior.

Create a timeline of recent changes

Review alerts and alarms Alerts and alarms can help you quickly determine the root cause of a problem by providing important clues as to the underlying issues that might be causing it.

Review the list of current alerts and alarms to see if StorageGRID has identified the root cause of a problem for you.

Manage alarms (legacy system)

Review alerts and alarms triggered in the past for additional insights.

Type of data to collect Why collect this data

Instructions Monitor events

Events include any system error or fault events for a node, including errors such as network errors. Monitor events to learn more about issues or to help with troubleshooting.

Monitor events

Identify trends using charts and text reports

Trends can provide valuable clues about when issues first appeared, and can help you understand how quickly things are changing.

Use charts and graphs After you have defined the problem and have assessed its risk and impact, collect data for analysis. The type of data that is most useful to collect depends upon the nature of the problem.
