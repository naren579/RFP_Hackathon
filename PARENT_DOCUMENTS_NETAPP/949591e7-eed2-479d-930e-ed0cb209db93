If the site included one or more Admin Nodes and single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, remove all relying party trusts for the site from Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).

After the nodes have been gracefully powered off automatically as part of the connected site decommission procedure, remove the associated virtual machines. Rename grid, site, or node

Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview

As required, you can change the display names that are shown throughout the Grid Manager for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can update display names safely and whenever you need.

What is the rename procedure?

When you install StorageGRID initially, you specify a name for the grid, each site, and each node. These initial

names are known as system names, and they are the names initially shown throughout StorageGRID.

System names are required for internal StorageGRID operations and can’t be changed. However, you can use the rename procedure to define new display names for the grid, each site, and each node. These display names appear in various StorageGRID locations instead of (or in some cases, in addition to) the underlying system names. Use the rename procedure to correct typos, to implement a different naming convention, or to indicate that a site and all of its nodes have been relocated. Unlike system names, display names can be updated whenever required and without impacting StorageGRID operations.

Where do system and display names appear?

The following table summarizes where system names and display names are shown in the StorageGRID user interface and in StorageGRID files. Location
