Manage the TLS and SSH policy

The TLS and SSH policy determines which protocols and ciphers are used to establish secure TLS connections with client applications and secure SSH connections to internal StorageGRID services.

The security policy controls how TLS and SSH encrypt data in motion. In general, use the Modern compatibility (default) policy, unless your system needs to be Common Criteria-compliant or you need to use other ciphers.

Some StorageGRID services have not been updated to use the ciphers in these policies.
