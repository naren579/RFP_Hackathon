This message is generated when an attempt by the Archive Node to retrieve object data from an external archival storage system completes. If successful, the message indicates that the requested object data has been completely read from the archive location, and was successfully verified. After the object data has been retrieved and verified, it is delivered to the requesting service. Code

Field

Description

CBID

Content Block ID The unique identifier of the Content Block to be retrieved from the

external archival storage system.

1341

Code

Field

Description

VLID

Volume Identifier The identifier of the volume on which the data was archived. If an

archive location for the content is not found, a Volume ID of 0 is returned. RSLT

Retrieval Result The completion status of the archive retrieval process:

SUCS: successful

VRFL: failed (object verification failure)

ARUN: failed (external archival storage system unavailable)

CANC: failed (retrieval operation canceled)

GERR: failed (general error)

Matching this message with the corresponding ARCB message can indicate the time taken to perform the archive retrieval. This message indicates whether the retrieval was successful, and in the case of failure, the cause of the failure to retrieve the content block. ARCT: Archive Retrieve from Cloud-Tier

This message is generated when archived object data is retrieved from an external archival storage system, which connects to the StorageGRID through the S3 API.

Code

Field

Description

CBID

Content Block ID The unique identifier for the content block that was retrieved. CSIZ

Content Size

The size of the object in bytes. The value is only accurate for successful retrieves.

RSLT

Result Code

Returns successful (SUCS) or the error reported by the backend.

SUID

Storage Unique Identifier

Unique identifier (UUID) of the external archival storage system.

TIME

Time Total processing time for the request in microseconds.

AREM: Archive Object Remove

The Archive Object Remove audit message indicates that a content block was successfully or unsuccessfully deleted from an Archive Node. If the result is successful, the Archive Node has successfully informed the external archival storage system that StorageGRID has released an object location. Whether the object is removed from the external archive storage system depends on the type of system and its configuration.

1342

Code

Field

Description CBID

Content Block ID The unique identifier of the Content Block to be retrieved from the

external archival media system.

VLID

Volume Identifier The identifier of the volume on which the object data was archived.

RSLT

Result

The completion status of the archive removal process:

SUCS: successful

ARUN: failed (external archival storage system unavailable)

GERR: failed (general error) ASCE: Archive Object Store End

This message indicates that writing a content block to an external archival storage system has ended.

Code

Field

Description

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The identifier of the content block stored on the external archival storage system.

VLID

Volume Identifier The unique identifier of the archive volume to which the object data is

written. VREN

Verification Enabled

Indicates if verification is performed for content blocks. Currently defined values are:

VENA: verification is enabled

VDSA: verification is disabled

MCLS

Management Class

A string identifying the TSM Management Class to which the content block is assigned if applicable. RSLT

Result

Indicates the result of the archive process. Currently defined values are:

SUCS: successful (archiving process succeeded)

OFFL: failed (archiving is offline)

VRFL: failed (object verification failed)

ARUN: failed (external archival storage system unavailable)

GERR: failed (general error)

This audit message means that the specified content block has been written to the external archival storage system. If the write fails, the result provides basic troubleshooting information about where the failure occurred. More detailed information about archive failures can be found by examining Archive Node attributes in the StorageGRID system.
