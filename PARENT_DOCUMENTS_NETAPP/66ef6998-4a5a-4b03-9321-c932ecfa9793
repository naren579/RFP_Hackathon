1. As soon as the Enable features task is complete (which occurs quickly), you can start using the new features in the upgraded StorageGRID version.

2. During the Upgrade database task, the upgrade process checks each node to verify that the Cassandra database does not need to be updated.

The upgrade from StorageGRID 11.7 to 11.8 does not require a Cassandra database upgrade; however, the Cassandra service will be stopped and restarted on each Storage Node. For future StorageGRID feature releases, the Cassandra database update step might take several days to complete.

3. When the Upgrade database task has completed, wait a few minutes for the Final upgrade steps to complete.

4. When the Final upgrade steps have completed, the upgrade is done. The first step, Select files, is redisplayed with a green success banner.

5. Verify that grid operations have returned to normal:

a. Check that the services are operating normally and that there are no unexpected alerts. b. Confirm that client connections to the StorageGRID system are operating as expected.

Troubleshoot upgrade issues

If something goes wrong when you perform an upgrade, you might able to resolve the issue yourself. If you can’t resolve an issue, gather as much information as you can and then contact technical support.

Upgrade does not complete

The following sections describe how to recover from situations where the upgrade has partially failed. Upgrade precheck errors

To detect and resolve issues, you can manually run the upgrade prechecks before starting the actual upgrade. Most precheck errors provide information about how to resolve the issue.

Provisioning failures

If the automatic provisioning process fails, contact technical support.

Grid node crashes or fails to start

If a grid node crashes during the upgrade process or fails to start successfully after the upgrade finishes, contact technical support to investigate and to correct any underlying issues.

Ingest or data retrieval is interrupted

If data ingest or retrieval is unexpectedly interrupted when you aren’t upgrading a grid node, contact technical

266

support. Database upgrade errors

If the database upgrade fails with an error, retry the upgrade. If it fails again, contact technical support.

Checking the system’s condition before upgrading software User interface issues

You might experience issues with the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager during or after the upgrade.

Grid Manager displays multiple error messages during upgrade

If you refresh your browser or navigate to another Grid Manager page while the primary Admin Node is being upgraded, you might see multiple "503: Service Unavailable" and "Problem connecting to the server" messages. You can safely ignore these messages—they will stop appearing soon as the node is upgraded.

If these messages appear for more than an hour after you started the upgrade, something might have occurred that prevented the primary Admin Node from being upgraded. If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, contact technical support.

Web interface does not respond as expected

The Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager might not respond as expected after StorageGRID software is upgraded.

If you experience issues with the web interface:

Make sure you are using a supported web browser. Browser support typically changes for each StorageGRID release. Ingest or data retrieval is interrupted

If data ingest or retrieval is unexpectedly interrupted when you aren’t upgrading a grid node, contact technical
