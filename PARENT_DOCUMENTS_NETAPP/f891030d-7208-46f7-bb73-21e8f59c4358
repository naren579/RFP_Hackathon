Appliance model

Storage controller name

Storage controller A management IP

Description

The model number for this StorageGRID appliance shown in SANtricity OS.

The name for this StorageGRID appliance shown in SANtricity OS.

IP address for management port 1 on storage controller A. You use this IP to access SANtricity OS to troubleshoot storage issues.

Description

IP address for management port 1 on storage controller B. You use this IP to access SANtricity OS to troubleshoot storage issues.

Some appliance models don’t have a storage controller B.

The worldwide identifier of the storage controller shown in SANtricity OS. The chassis serial number of the appliance.

The version of the firmware on the storage controller for this appliance.

The overall status of the storage controller hardware. If SANtricity System Manager reports a status of Needs Attention for the storage hardware, the StorageGRID system also reports this value.

If the status is "needs attention," first check the storage controller using SANtricity OS. Then, ensure that no other alarms exist that apply to the compute controller.

The number of drives that aren’t optimal. The status of storage controller A.

The status of storage controller B. Some appliance models don’t have a storage controller B.

The status of power supply A for the storage controller.

The status of power supply B for the storage controller.

The type of drives in the appliance, such as HDD (hard drive) or SSD (solid state drive). The effective size of one data drive.

Note: For nodes with expansion shelves, use the Data drive size for each shelf instead. Effective drive size might differ by shelf.

The RAID mode configured for the appliance.
