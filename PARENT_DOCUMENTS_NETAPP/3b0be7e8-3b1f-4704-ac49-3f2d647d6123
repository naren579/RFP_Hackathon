CLIENT_NETWORK_IP: The IP address for the node on the Client Network. Required only if the node is attached to the Client Network and CLIENT_NETWORK_CONFIG for this node is set to STATIC. ADMIN_IP: The IP address for the primary Admin node on the Grid Network. Use the value that you specify as the GRID_NETWORK_IP for the primary Admin Node. If you omit this parameter, the node attempts to discover the primary Admin Node IP using mDNS. For more information, see How grid nodes discover the primary Admin Node.

The ADMIN_IP parameter is ignored for the primary Admin Node.

Any parameters that were not set globally. For example, if a node is attached to the Admin Network and

217

you did not specify ADMIN_NETWORK parameters globally, you must specify them for the node. Primary Admin Node

The following additional settings are required for the primary Admin Node:

NODE_TYPE: VM_Admin_Node

ADMIN_ROLE: Primary

This example entry is for a primary Admin Node that is on all three networks:

[DC1-ADM1] ADMIN_ROLE = Primary NODE_TYPE = VM_Admin_Node

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.0.2 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP = 10.3.0.2 CLIENT_NETWORK_IP = 10.4.0.2

The following additional setting is optional for the primary Admin Node:

DISK: By default, Admin Nodes are assigned two additional 200 GB hard disks for audit and database use. You can increase these settings using the DISK parameter. For example: DISK = INSTANCES=2, CAPACITY=300

For Admin nodes, INSTANCES must always equal 2.

Storage Node

The following additional setting is required for Storage Nodes:

NODE_TYPE: VM_Storage_Node

This example entry is for a Storage Node that is on the Grid and Admin Networks, but not on the Client Network. This node uses the ADMIN_IP setting to specify the primary Admin Node’s IP address on the Grid Network. [DC1-S1] NODE_TYPE = VM_Storage_Node

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.0.3 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP = 10.3.0.3

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

This second example entry is for a Storage Node on a Client Network where the customer’s enterprise networking policy states that an S3 client application is only permitted to access the Storage Node using

218

either port 80 or 443. The example configuration file uses PORT_REMAP to enable the Storage Node to send and receive S3 messages on port 443. [DC2-S1] NODE_TYPE = VM_Storage_Node For Admin nodes, INSTANCES must always equal 2.

Storage Node

The following additional setting is required for Storage Nodes:

NODE_TYPE: VM_Storage_Node

This example entry is for a Storage Node that is on the Grid and Admin Networks, but not on the Client Network. This node uses the ADMIN_IP setting to specify the primary Admin Node’s IP address on the Grid Network. [DC1-S1] NODE_TYPE = VM_Storage_Node

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.0.3 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP = 10.3.0.3

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

This second example entry is for a Storage Node on a Client Network where the customer’s enterprise networking policy states that an S3 client application is only permitted to access the Storage Node using

218

either port 80 or 443. The example configuration file uses PORT_REMAP to enable the Storage Node to send and receive S3 messages on port 443. [DC2-S1] NODE_TYPE = VM_Storage_Node

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.1.3 CLIENT_NETWORK_IP = 10.4.1.3 PORT_REMAP = client/tcp/18082/443

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

The last example creates a symmetric remapping for ssh traffic from port 22 to port 3022, but explicitly sets the values for both inbound and outbound traffic. [DC1-S3] NODE_TYPE = VM_Storage_Node

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.1.3

PORT_REMAP = grid/tcp/22/3022 PORT_REMAP_INBOUND = grid/tcp/3022/22

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

The following additional setting is optional for Storage Nodes:

DISK: By default, Storage Nodes are assigned three 4 TB disks for RangeDB use. You can increase these settings with the DISK parameter. For example: DISK = INSTANCES=16, CAPACITY=4096

Archive Node

The following additional setting is required for Archive Nodes:

NODE_TYPE: VM_Archive_Node

This example entry is for an Archive Node that is on the Grid and Admin Networks, but not on the Client Network.

219

[DC1-ARC1] NODE_TYPE = VM_Archive_Node GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.0.4 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP = 10.3.0.4

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

Gateway Node

The following additional setting is required for Gateway Nodes:

NODE_TYPE: VM_API_Gateway

This example entry is for an example Gateway Node on all three networks. In this example, no Client Network parameters were specified in the global section of the configuration file, so they must be specified for the node: [DC1-G1] NODE_TYPE = VM_API_Gateway

GRID_NETWORK_IP = 10.1.0.5 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP = 10.3.0.5

CLIENT_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET = SG-Client-Network CLIENT_NETWORK_MASK = 255.255.255.0 CLIENT_NETWORK_GATEWAY = 10.4.0.1 CLIENT_NETWORK_IP = 10.4.0.5

ADMIN_IP = 10.1.0.2

Non-primary Admin Node

The following additional settings are required for non-primary Admin Nodes:

NODE_TYPE: VM_Admin_Node

ADMIN_ROLE: Non-Primary
