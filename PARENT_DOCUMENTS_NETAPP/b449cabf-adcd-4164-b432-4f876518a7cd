View the Nodes page: Overview

When you need more detailed information about your StorageGRID system than the dashboard provides, you can use the Nodes page to view metrics for the entire grid, each site in the grid, and each node at a site.

The Nodes table lists summary information for the entire grid, each site, and each node. If a node is disconnected or has an active alert, an icon appears next to the node name. If the node is connected and has no active alerts, no icon is shown.

When a node is not connected to the grid, such as during upgrade or a disconnected state, certain metrics might be unavailable or excluded from site and grid totals. After a node reconnects to the grid, wait several minutes for the values to stabilize.

To change units for the storage values displayed in the Grid Manager, select the user drop-down in the upper right of the Grid Manager, then select User preferences.
