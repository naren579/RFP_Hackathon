./rpms/extras/api-schemas

API schemas for StorageGRID.

Note: Before you perform an upgrade, you can use these schemas to confirm that any code you have written to use StorageGRID management APIs will be compatible with the new StorageGRID release if you don’t have a non-production StorageGRID environment for upgrade compatibility testing. Software requirements for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

You can use a virtual machine to host any type of StorageGRID node. You need one virtual machine for each grid node.

To install StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), you must install some third-party software packages. Some supported Linux distributions don’t contain these packages by default. The software package versions that StorageGRID installations are tested on include those listed on this page.

If you select a Linux distribution and container runtime installation option that requires any of these packages, and they are not installed automatically by the Linux distribution, install one of the versions listed here if available from your provider or the supporting vendor for your Linux distribution. Otherwise, use the default package versions available from your vendor.

All installation options require either Podman or Docker. Do not install both packages. Install only the package required by your installation option. Python versions tested

1.5-2 CPU and RAM requirements

Before installing StorageGRID software, verify and configure the hardware so that it is ready to support the StorageGRID system.

Each StorageGRID node requires the following minimum resources:

CPU cores: 8 per node

RAM: At least 24 GB per node, and 2 to 16 GB less than the total system RAM, depending on the total RAM available and the amount of non-StorageGRID software running on the system
