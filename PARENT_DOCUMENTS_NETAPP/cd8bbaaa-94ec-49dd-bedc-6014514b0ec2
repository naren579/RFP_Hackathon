      <td>Each Storage Node includes the Local Distribution Router (LDR) service.\nThis service handles content transport functions, including data storage,\nrouting, and request handling. The LDR service does most of the\nStorageGRID system’s hard work by handling data transfer loads and data\ntraffic functions.\nThe LDR service handles the following tasks:\n• Queries\n• Information lifecycle management (ILM) activity\n• Object deletion\n• Object data storage\n• Object data transfers from another LDR service (Storage Node)\n• Data storage management\n• Protocol interfaces (S3 and Swift)\nThe LDR service also maps each S3 and Swift object to its unique UUID.\nObject stores\nThe underlying data storage of an LDR service is divided into a fixed\nnumber of object stores (also known as storage volumes). Each object\nstore is a separate mount point.\nThe object stores in a Storage Node are identified by a hexadecimal\nnumber from 0000 to 002F, which is known as the volume ID. Space is\nreserved in the first object store (volume 0) for object metadata in a\nCassandra database; any remaining space on that volume is used for\nobject data. All other object stores are used exclusively for object data,\nwhich includes replicated copies and erasure-coded fragments.\nTo ensure even space usage for replicated copies, object data for a given\nobject is stored to one object store based on available storage space.\nWhen an object store fills to capacity, the remaining object stores\ncontinue to store objects until there is no more room on the Storage\nNode.\nMetadata protection\nStorageGRID stores object metadata in a Cassandra database, which\ninterfaces with the LDR service.\nTo ensure redundancy and thus protection against loss, three copies of\nobject metadata are maintained at each site. This replication is non-\nManage object configurable and performed automatically. For details, see\nmetadata storage.</td>
