This message is issued whenever a content block fails the verification process. Each time replicated object data is read from or written to disk, several verification and integrity checks are performed to ensure the data sent to the requesting user is identical to the data originally ingested into the system. If any of these checks fail, the system automatically quarantines the corrupt replicated object data to prevent it from being retrieved again.
