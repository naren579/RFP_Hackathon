1. Specify the IPv4 addresses for at least four NTP servers in the Server 1 to Server 4 text boxes.

2. If necessary, select the plus sign next to the last entry to add additional server entries.

3. Select Next. Specify DNS server information

You must specify DNS information for your StorageGRID system, so that you can access external servers using hostnames instead of IP addresses.

About this task

Specifying DNS server information allows you to use Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) hostnames rather than IP addresses for email notifications and AutoSupport.

To ensure proper operation, specify two or three DNS servers. If you specify more than three, it is possible that only three will be used because of known OS limitations on some platforms. If you have routing restrictions in your environment, you can customize the DNS server list for individual nodes (typically all nodes at a site) to use a different set of up to three DNS servers.

If possible, use DNS servers that each site can access locally to ensure that an islanded site can resolve the FQDNs for external destinations. If the DNS server information is omitted or incorrectly configured, a DNST alarm is triggered on each grid nodeâ€™s SSM service. The alarm clears when DNS is configured correctly and the new server information has reached all grid nodes.

Steps

1. Specify the IPv4 address for at least one DNS server in the Server 1 text box.

2. If necessary, select the plus sign next to the last entry to add additional server entries.

The best practice is to specify at least two DNS servers. You can specify up to six DNS servers.

3. Select Next.

Specify the StorageGRID system passwords

As part of installing your StorageGRID system, you need to enter the passwords to use to secure your system and perform maintenance tasks. About this task

Use the Install passwords page to specify the provisioning passphrase and the grid management root user password.

The provisioning passphrase is used as an encryption key and is not stored by the StorageGRID system.

You must have the provisioning passphrase for installation, expansion, and maintenance procedures, including downloading the Recovery Package. Therefore, it is important that you store the provisioning

241

passphrase in a secure location.

You can change the provisioning passphrase from the Grid Manager if you have the current one.

The grid management root user password can be changed using the Grid Manager.

Randomly generated command line console and SSH passwords are stored in the Passwords.txt file in the Recovery Package. Steps

1. In Provisioning Passphrase, enter the provisioning passphrase that will be required to make changes to the grid topology of your StorageGRID system.

Store the provisioning passphrase in a secure place.

If after the installation completes and you want to change the provisioning passphrase later, you can use the Grid Manager. Select CONFIGURATION > Access control > Grid passwords.

2. In Confirm Provisioning Passphrase, reenter the provisioning passphrase to confirm it. As part of installing your StorageGRID system, you need to enter the passwords to use to secure your system and perform maintenance tasks. About this task

3. In Grid Management Root User Password, enter the password to use to access the Grid Manager as the "root" user. Store the password in a secure place.

4. In Confirm Root User Password, reenter the Grid Manager password to confirm it.

5. If you are installing a grid for proof of concept or demo purposes, optionally clear the Create random command line passwords checkbox.

For production deployments, random passwords should always be used for security reasons. Clear Create
