The PUT Bucket last access time request allows you to enable or disable last access time updates for individual buckets. Disabling last access time updates improves performance, and is the default setting for all buckets created with version 10.3.0, or later.

You must have the s3:PutBucketLastAccessTime permission for a bucket, or be account root, to complete this operation.

Starting with StorageGRID version 10.3, updates to last access time are disabled by default for all new buckets. If you have buckets that were created using an earlier version of StorageGRID and you want to match the new default behavior, you must explicitly disable last access time updates for each of those earlier buckets. You can enable or disable updates to last access time using the PUT Bucket last access time request or from the details page for a bucket in the Tenant Manager. See Enable or disable last access time updates. If last access time updates are disabled for a bucket, the following behavior is applied to operations on the bucket:

GetObject, GetObjectAcl, GetObjectTagging, and HeadObject requests don’t update last access time. The object is not added to queues for information lifecycle management (ILM) evaluation.

CopyObject and PutObjectTagging requests that update only the metadata also update last access time. The object is added to queues for ILM evaluation.

If updates to last access time are disabled for the source bucket, CopyObject requests don’t update last access time for the source bucket. The object that was copied is not added to queues for ILM evaluation for the source bucket. However, for the destination, CopyObject requests always update last access time. The copy of the object is added to queues for ILM evaluation.

CompleteMultipartUpload requests update last access time. The completed object is added to queues for ILM evaluation. Request examples

This example enables last access time for a bucket.
