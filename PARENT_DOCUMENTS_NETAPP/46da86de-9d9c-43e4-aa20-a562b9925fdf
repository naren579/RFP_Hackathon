Because version IDs for the source and destination aren’t related,\nthere is no way to ensure that a tag update to a specific version ID will be\nreplicated.\nIn contrast, the CloudMirror service does replicate PutObjectTagging requests or\nDeleteObjectTagging requests that don’t specify a version ID. These requests\nupdate the tags for the latest key (or the latest version if the bucket is versioned).\nNormal ingests with tags (not tagging updates) are also replicated.</td>
