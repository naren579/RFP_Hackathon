Configure high availability groups Summary: IP addresses and ports for client connections

To store or retrieve objects, S3 and Swift client applications connect to the Load Balancer service, which is included on all Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes, or to the Local Distribution Router (LDR) service, which is included on all Storage Nodes.

Client applications can connect to StorageGRID using the IP address of a grid node and the port number of the service on that node. Optionally, you can create high availability (HA) groups of load-balancing nodes to provide highly available connections that use virtual IP (VIP) addresses. If you want to connect to StorageGRID using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) instead of an IP or VIP address, you can configure DNS entries. This table summarizes the different ways that clients can connect to StorageGRID and the IP addresses and ports that are used for each type of connection. If you have already created load balancer endpoints and high availability (HA) groups, see Where to find IP addresses to locate these values in the Grid Manager.

Example URLs

To connect a client application to the Load Balancer endpoint of an HA group of Gateway Nodes, use a URL structured as shown below:

https://VIP-of-HA-group:LB-endpoint-port

For example, if the virtual IP address of the HA group is 192.0.2.5 and the port number of the load balancer endpoint is 10443, then an application could use the following URL to connect to StorageGRID:

https://192.0.2.5:10443

Where to find IP addresses

1. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

2. To find the IP address of a grid node: a. Select NODES.

b. Select the Admin Node, Gateway Node, or Storage Node to which you want to connect.

c. Select the Overview tab.

d. In the Node Information section, note the IP addresses for the node.

e. Select Show more to view IPv6 addresses and interface mappings.

You can establish connections from client applications to any of the IP addresses in the list:

▪ eth0: Grid Network ▪ eth1: Admin Network (optional) ▪ eth2: Client Network (optional)

If you are viewing an Admin Node or a Gateway Node and it is the active node in a high availability group, the virtual IP address of the HA group is shown on eth2.

3. To find the virtual IP address of a high availability group: a. Select CONFIGURATION > Network > High availability groups.
