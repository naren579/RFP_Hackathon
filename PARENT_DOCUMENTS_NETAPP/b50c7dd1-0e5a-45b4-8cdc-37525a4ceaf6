Reasons for this might include:\n• The syslog server might have been restarted or rebooted.\n• The node and the syslog server might have different TCP/TLS settings.\n• An intermediate firewall might be closing idle TCP connections.\n• A non-syslog server listening on the syslog server port might have closed the\nconnection.\nTo resolve this issue:\n1. Check that you entered the correct FQDN or IP address, port, and protocol for\nthe syslog server.\n2. If you are using TLS, confirm the syslog server is also using TLS. If you are\nusing TCP, confirm the syslog server is also using TCP.\n3. Check that an intermediate firewall is not configured to close idle TCP\nconnections.</td>
