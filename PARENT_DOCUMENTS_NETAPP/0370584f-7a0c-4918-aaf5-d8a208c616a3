Certificate examples

Example 1: Load Balancer service

In this example, StorageGRID acts as the server.

1. You configure a load balancer endpoint and upload or generate a server certificate in StorageGRID.

2. You configure an S3 or Swift client connection to the load balancer endpoint and upload the same certificate to the client.

3. When the client wants to save or retrieve data, it connects to the load balancer endpoint using HTTPS.

4. StorageGRID responds with the server certificate, which contains a public key, and with a signature based on the private key.

5. The client verifies this certificate by comparing the server signature to the signature on its copy of the certificate. If the signatures match, the client starts a session using the same public key.
