While the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the alert system offers significant benefits and is easier to use.

Global Custom alarms override Default alarms. You should not change Default alarm values unless absolutely necessary. By changing Default alarms, you run the risk of concealing problems that might otherwise trigger an alarm. Be careful if you change alarm settings. For example, if you increase the threshold value for an alarm, you might not detect an underlying problem. Discuss your proposed changes with technical support before changing an alarm setting.
