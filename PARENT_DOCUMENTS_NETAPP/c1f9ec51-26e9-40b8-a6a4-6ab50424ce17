After you have investigated and corrected the problem, restart the grid task. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > CMN > Grid Tasks > Configuration > Main, and select Actions > Run.

If the value of Status for a grid task being stopped is Error, retry ending the grid task.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

Triggered when the certificate used for accessing storage API endpoints is about to expire.

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Security > Certificates.

2. On the Global tab, select S3 and Swift API certificate.

3. Upload a new S3 and Swift API certificate.

Recommended action

If the value of Status for the historical grid task is Aborted, investigate the reason and run the task again if required.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with storage controller A in a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with storage controller B in a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

Some appliance models donâ€™t have a storage controller B.

If the value of Health for an object store is Error, check and correct:

problems with the volume being mounted

file system errors The higher the value the busier the system.

If the CPU Load Average persists at a high value, the number of transactions in the system should be investigated to determine whether this is due to heavy load at the time. View a chart of the CPU load average: Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > SSM > Resources > Reports > Charts.

If the load on the system is not heavy and the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of Log Monitor State is not Connected for a persistent period of time, contact technical support.

Recommended action

If the value of Total Events is greater than zero, check if there are known events (such as network failures) that can be the cause. Unless these errors have been cleared (that is, the count has been reset to 0), Total Events alarms can be triggered.

When an issue is resolved, reset the counter to clear the alarm. Select NODES > site > grid node > Events > Reset event counts.

To reset event counts, you must have the Grid topology page configuration permission.

If the value of Total Events is zero, or the number increases and the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm indicates that there is a problem storing the grid task bundles. If the value of Status is Checkpoint Error or Quorum Not Reached, confirm that a majority of ADC services are connected to the StorageGRID system (50 percent plus one) and then wait a few minutes.

If the problem persists, contact technical support. An alarm is triggered if SANtricity OS indicates that there is a "Needs attention" issue with a component in a StorageGRID appliance.

Select NODES. Then select appliance Storage Node > Hardware. Scroll down to view the status of each component. In SANtricity OS, check other appliance components to isolate the issue.

If the value of SSM Status is Error, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology, then select site > grid node > SSM > Overview > Main and SSM > Overview > Alarms to determine the cause of the alarm.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of SSM State is Standby, continue monitoring, and if the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of SSM State is Offline, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support.
