If the node decommission procedure stops because of an error, you can take specific steps to troubleshoot the problem.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser. About this task

If you shut down the grid node being decommissioned, the task stops until the grid node is restarted. The grid node must be online.

Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. In the Grid Topology tree, expand each Storage Node entry, and verify that the DDS and LDR services are both online.

To perform Storage Node decommissioning, all nodes and all services need to be healthy at the start of an

1454

online node/site decommissioning.

3. To view the active grid tasks, select primary Admin Node > CMN > Grid Tasks > Overview. Evaluating ILM ◦ Decommissioning Erasure-Coded Data

3. Select Pause to suspend the procedure.

The current stage is paused, and the Resume button is enabled.

4. After the other maintenance procedure is finished, select Resume to proceed with the decommission.

Troubleshoot node decommissioning

3. To view the active grid tasks, select primary Admin Node > CMN > Grid Tasks > Overview.

4. Check the status of the decommissioning grid task.

a. If the status of the decommissioning grid task indicates a problem with saving grid task bundles, select primary Admin Node > CMN > Events > Overview.

b. Check the number of Available Audit Relays.

If the attribute Available Audit Relay is one or greater, the CMN service is connected to at least one ADC service. ADC services act as Audit Relays.

The CMN service must be connected to at least one ADC service and a majority (50 percent plus one) of the StorageGRID system’s ADC services must be available in order for a grid task to move from one stage of decommissioning to another and finish.

c. If the CMN service is not connected to enough ADC services, ensure that Storage Nodes are online,

and check network connectivity between the primary Admin Node and Storage Nodes. Decommission site

Considerations for removing a site

Before using the site decommission procedure to remove a site, you must review the considerations.

What happens when you decommission a site

When you decommission a site, StorageGRID permanently removes all nodes at the site and the site itself from the StorageGRID system.

When the site decommission procedure is complete:

You can no longer use StorageGRID to view or access the site or any of the nodes at the site.

You can no longer use any storage pools or erasure-coding profiles that referred to the site. When StorageGRID decommissions a site, it automatically removes these storage pools and deactivates these erasure-coding profiles.

Differences between connected site and disconnected site decommission procedures You can use the site decommission procedure to remove a site in which all nodes are connected to StorageGRID (referred to as a connected site decommission) or to remove a site in which all nodes are disconnected from StorageGRID (referred to as a disconnected site decommission). Before you begin, you must understand the differences between these procedures.

If a site contains a mixture of connected ( bring all offline nodes back online.

) and disconnected nodes ( or

), you must

A connected site decommission allows you to remove an operational site from the StorageGRID system. For example, you can perform a connected site decommission to remove a site that is functional but no longer needed.

When StorageGRID removes a connected site, it uses ILM to manage the object data at the site. Before

you can start a connected site decommission, you must remove the site from all ILM rules and activate a new ILM policy. The ILM processes to migrate object data and the internal processes to remove a site can occur at the same time, but the best practice is to allow the ILM steps to complete before you start the actual decommission procedure.
