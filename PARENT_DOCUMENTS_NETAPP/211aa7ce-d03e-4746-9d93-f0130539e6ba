An ILM policy that has been incorrectly configured can result in unrecoverable data loss. Before activating an ILM policy, carefully review the ILM policy and its ILM rules, and then simulate the ILM policy. Always confirm that the ILM policy will work as intended. Steps

1. Select ILM > Rules.

2. Confirm that the rule you want to edit is not used in any ILM policy.

3. If the rule you want to edit is not in use, select the checkbox for the rule and select Actions > Edit. Alternatively, select the name of the rule, then select Edit on the rule details page.

4. Complete the steps of the Edit ILM rule wizard. As necessary, follow the steps for creating an ILM rule and using advanced filters in ILM rules.

When editing an ILM rule, you can’t change its name.

Remove an ILM rule

To keep the list of current ILM rules manageable, remove any ILM rules that you aren’t likely to use. Steps

To remove an ILM rule that is currently used in an active policy:

1. Clone the policy.

2. Remove the ILM rule from the policy clone.

3. Save, simulate, and activate the new policy to make sure objects are protected as expected.

4. Go to the steps for removing an ILM rule that is currently used in an inactive policy.

To remove an ILM rule that is currently used in an inactive policy:

1. Select the inactive policy.

2. Remove the ILM rule from the policy or remove the policy. 1. Select ILM > Rules.

You can view metrics for ILM, such as the number of objects in the queue and the evaluation rate. You can monitor these metrics to determine system performance. A large queue or evaluation rate might indicate that the system is not able to keep up with the ingest rate, the load from the client applications is excessive, or that some abnormal condition exists.

Because the dashboard can be customized, the ILM tab might not be available.

2. Monitor the metrics on the ILM tab.

Manage objects with S3 Object Lock

As a grid administrator, you can enable S3 Object Lock for your StorageGRID system and implement a compliant ILM policy to help ensure that objects in specific S3 buckets aren’t deleted or overwritten for a specified amount of time. What is S3 Object Lock?

The StorageGRID S3 Object Lock feature is an object-protection solution that is equivalent to S3 Object Lock in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

As shown in the figure, when the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled for a StorageGRID system, an S3 tenant account can create buckets with or without S3 Object Lock enabled. If a bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled, bucket versioning is required and is enabled automatically.

If a bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled, S3 client applications can optionally specify retention settings for any object version saved to that bucket.

In addition, a bucket that has S3 Object Lock enabled can optionally have a default retention mode and retention period. The default settings apply only to objects that are added to the bucket without their own

retention settings. Retention modes

The StorageGRID S3 Object Lock feature supports two retention modes to apply different levels of protection to objects. These modes are equivalent to the Amazon S3 retention modes.
