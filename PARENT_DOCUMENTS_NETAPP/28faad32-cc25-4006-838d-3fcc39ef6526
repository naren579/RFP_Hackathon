Limitations

StorageGRID supports read-only MIB access. Read-write access is not supported.

All nodes in the grid receive the same configuration.

SNMPv3: StorageGRID does not support the Transport Support Mode (TSM).

SNMPv3: The only authentication protocol supported is SHA (HMAC-SHA-96).

SNMPv3: The only privacy protocol supported is AES. Configure the SNMP agent

You can configure the StorageGRID SNMP agent to use a third-party SNMP management system for read-only MIB access and notifications.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Root access permission.

About this task

The StorageGRID SNMP agent supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. You can configure the agent for one or more versions. For SNMPv3, only User Security Model (USM) authentication is supported.

All nodes in the grid use the same SNMP configuration. Specify basic configuration

As a first step, enable the StorageGRID SMNP agent and provide basic information.

Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Monitoring > SNMP agent.

The SNMP agent page appears.

2. To enable the SNMP agent on all grid nodes, select the Enable SNMP checkbox.

3. Enter the following information in the Basic configuration section. Field

Description

System contact

Optional. The primary contact for the StorageGRID system, which is returned in SNMP messages as sysContact.

The System contact is typically an email address. This value applies to all nodes in the StorageGRID system. System contact can be a maximum of 255 characters.

Field

Description System location

Optional. The location of the StorageGRID system, which is returned in SNMP messages as sysLocation. Before you begin

Field

Description System location

Optional. The location of the StorageGRID system, which is returned in SNMP messages as sysLocation.

The System location can be any information that is useful for identifying where your StorageGRID system is located. For example, you might use the street address of a facility. This value applies to all nodes in the StorageGRID system. System location can be a maximum of 255 characters. Enable SNMP agent notifications

If selected, the StorageGRID SNMP agent sends trap and inform notifications.

If not selected, the SNMP agent supports read-only MIB access, but it doesn’t send any SNMP notifications.

Enable authentication traps

If selected, the StorageGRID SNMP agent sends authentication traps if it receives improperly authenticated protocol messages. Enter community strings

If you use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, complete the Community strings section.

When the management system queries the StorageGRID MIB, it sends a community string. If the community string matches one of the values specified here, the SNMP agent sends a response to the management system. Steps

1. For Read-only community, optionally enter a community string to allow read-only MIB access on IPv4 and IPv6 agent addresses.

To ensure the security of your StorageGRID system, don’t use "public" as the community string. If you leave this field blank, the SNMP agent uses the grid ID of your StorageGRID system as the community string.

Each community string can be a maximum of 32 characters and can’t contain whitespace characters.

2. Select Add another community string to add additional strings.

Up to five strings are allowed. Create trap destinations

Use the Trap destinations tab in the Other configurations section to define one or more destinations for StorageGRID trap or inform notifications. When you enable the SNMP agent and select Save, StorageGRID sends notifications to each defined destination when alerts are triggered. Standard notifications are also sent for the supported MIB-II entities (for example, ifDown and coldStart). Steps

1. For the Default trap community field, optionally enter the default community string you want to use for SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 trap destinations.
