2. Indicate whether you want to access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager:

To access the Grid Manager, leave the Account ID field blank, enter 0 as the account ID, or select Grid Manager if it appears in the list of recent accounts. To access the Tenant Manager, enter the 20-digit tenant account ID or select a tenant by name if it appears in the list of recent accounts.

3. Select Sign in

StorageGRID redirects you to your organization’s SSO sign-in page. For example:

4. Sign in with your SSO credentials.

If your SSO credentials are correct:

a. The identity provider (IdP) provides an authentication response to StorageGRID.

b. StorageGRID validates the authentication response.

c. If the response is valid and you belong to a federated group with StorageGRID access permissions, you are signed in to the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager, depending on which account you selected.

If the service account is inaccessible, you can still sign in, as long as you are an existing user that belongs to a federated group with StorageGRID access permissions.

5. Optionally, access other Admin Nodes, or access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager, if you have adequate permissions. You don’t need to reenter your SSO credentials.

Sign out when SSO is enabled

When SSO is enabled for StorageGRID, what happens when you sign out depends on what you are signed in to and where you are signing out from.

Steps

1. Locate the Sign out link in the top-right corner of the user interface.

And you sign out from…

You are signed out of… Grid Manager on one or more Admin Nodes

Grid Manager on any Admin Node Grid Manager on all Admin Nodes

Note: If you use Azure for SSO, it might take a few minutes to be signed out of all Admin Nodes.

Tenant Manager on one or more Admin Nodes

Tenant Manager on any Admin Node

Tenant Manager on all Admin Nodes Both Grid Manager and Tenant Manager

Grid Manager

The Grid Manager only. You must also sign out of the Tenant Manager to sign out of SSO.

The table summarizes what happens when you sign out if you are using a single browser session. If you are signed in to StorageGRID across multiple browser sessions, you must sign out of all browser sessions separately. Requirements and considerations for single sign-on

Before enabling single sign-on (SSO) for a StorageGRID system, review the requirements and considerations.

Identity provider requirements

StorageGRID supports the following SSO identity providers (IdP):

Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

PingFederate

You must configure identity federation for your StorageGRID system before you can configure an SSO identity provider. The type of LDAP service you use for identity federation controls which type of SSO you can implement.
