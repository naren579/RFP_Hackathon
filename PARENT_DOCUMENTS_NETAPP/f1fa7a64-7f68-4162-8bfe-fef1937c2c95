GET /bucket?x-ntap-sg-metadata-notification HTTP/1.1 Date: date Authorization: authorization string Host: host Response

The response body includes the metadata notification configuration for the bucket. The metadata notification configuration lets you determine how the bucket is configured for search integration. That is, it allows you to determine which objects are indexed, and which endpoints their object metadata is being sent to.

<MetadataNotificationConfiguration> <Rule> <ID>Rule-1</ID> <Status>rule-status</Status> <Prefix>key-prefix</Prefix> <Destination> <Urn>arn:aws:es:_region:account- ID_:domain/_mydomain/myindex/mytype_</Urn> </Destination> </Rule> <Rule> <ID>Rule-2</ID> ... </Rule> ... </MetadataNotificationConfiguration>

Each metadata notification configuration includes one or more rules. Each rule specifies the objects that it applies to and the destination where StorageGRID should send object metadata. Destinations must be specified using the URN of a StorageGRID endpoint. Name

The URN must end with the index and type where the metadata is stored, in the form domain- name/myindex/mytype.

Endpoints are configured using the Tenant Manager or Tenant Management API. They take the following form:

arn:aws:es:_region:account- ID_:domain/mydomain/myindex/mytype

urn:mysite:es:::mydomain/myindex/myty pe

The endpoint must be configured before the configuration XML is submitted, or configuration will fail with a 404 error.

Urn is included in the Destination element.

Response example

The XML included between the <MetadataNotificationConfiguration></MetadataNotificationConfiguration> tags shows how integration with a search integration endpoint is configured for the bucket. In this example, object metadata is being sent to an Elasticsearch index named current and type named 2017 that is hosted in an AWS domain named records.
