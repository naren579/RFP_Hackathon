Verify the installed version of StorageGRID

Before starting the upgrade, verify that the previous version of StorageGRID is currently installed with the latest available hotfix applied. About this task

Before you upgrade to StorageGRID 11.8, your grid must have StorageGRID 11.7 installed. If you are currently using a previous version of StorageGRID, you must install all previous upgrade files along with their latest hotfixes (strongly recommended) until your grid’s current version is StorageGRID 11.7.x.y.

One possible upgrade path is shown in the example.

NetApp strongly recommends that you apply the latest hotfix for each StorageGRID version before upgrading to the next version and that you also apply the latest hotfix for each new version you install. In some cases, you must apply a hotfix to avoid the risk of data loss. See NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID and the release notes for each hotfix to learn more. Steps

1. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

2. From the top of the Grid Manager, select Help > About.

3. Verify that Version is 11.7.x.y. In the StorageGRID 11.7.x.y version number:

The major release has an x value of 0 (11.7.0). ◦ A hotfix, if one has been applied, has a y value (for example, 11.7.0.1).

4. If Version is not 11.7.x.y, go to NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID to download the files for each previous release, including the latest hotfix for each release.

5. Obtain the the upgrade instructions for each release you downloaded. Then, perform the software upgrade procedure for that release, and apply the latest hotfix for that release (strongly recommended).

See the StorageGRID hotfix procedure.
