View the ILM tab

The ILM tab provides information about information lifecycle management (ILM) operations.

The ILM tab is shown for each Storage Node, each site, and the entire grid. For each site and the grid, the ILM tab shows a graph of the ILM queue over time. For the grid, this tab also provides the estimated time to complete a full ILM scan of all objects.

For Storage Nodes, the ILM tab provides details about ILM evaluation and background verification for erasure- coded objects.

Use the Tasks tab

The Tasks tab is shown for all nodes. You can use this tab to rename or reboot a node or to put an appliance node into maintenance mode.

For the complete requirements and instructions for each option on this tab, see the following:

Rename grid, sites, and nodes

Reboot grid node

Place appliance into maintenance mode View the Load balancer tab

The Load Balancer tab includes performance and diagnostic graphs related to the operation of the Load Balancer service.

The Load Balancer tab is shown for Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes, each site, and the entire grid. For each site, the Load Balancer tab provides an aggregate summary of the statistics for all nodes at that site. For the entire grid, the Load Balancer tab provides an aggregate summary of the statistics for all sites.

If there is no I/O being run through the Load Balancer service, or there is no load balancer configured, the graphs display "No data."

1044 Request traffic

This graph provides a 3-minute moving average of the throughput of data transmitted between load balancer endpoints and the clients making the requests, in bits per second. Related information Monitor information lifecycle management

1044 Request traffic

This graph provides a 3-minute moving average of the throughput of data transmitted between load balancer endpoints and the clients making the requests, in bits per second.

This value is updated at the completion of each request. As a result, this value might differ from the real-time throughput at low request rates or for very long-lived requests. You can look at the Network tab to get a more realistic view of the current network behavior.

Incoming request rate

This graph provides a 3-minute moving average of the number of new requests per second, broken down by request type (GET, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE). This value is updated when the headers of a new request have been validated. Average request duration (non-error)

This graph provides a 3-minute moving average of request durations, broken down by request type (GET, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE). Each request duration starts when a request header is parsed by the Load Balancer service and ends when the complete response body is returned to the client.

1045

Error response rate

This graph provides a 3-minute moving average of the number of error responses returned to clients per second, broken down by the error response code.

Administer StorageGRID View the Platform services tab

The Platform services tab provides information about any S3 platform service operations at a site.

The Platform services tab is shown for each site. This tab provides information about S3 platform services, such as CloudMirror replication and the search integration service. Graphs on this tab display metrics such as the number of pending requests, request completion rate, and request failure rate.
