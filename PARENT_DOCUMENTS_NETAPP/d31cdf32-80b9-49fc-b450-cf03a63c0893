If the value of ARC State does not transition from Standby to Online, check the status of the ARC components.

If the value of ARC State is Offline, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

This alarm can be triggered if the removable storage device is running slowly due to problems with the targeted external archival storage system, or if it encounters multiple read errors. Check the external archival storage system for errors, and ensure that it is operating correctly.

In some cases, this error can occur as a result of a high rate of data requests. Monitor the number of objects queued as system activity declines.

Recommended action

If a retrieval from the targeted external archival storage system fails, the Archive Node retries the retrieval as the failure can be due to a transient issue. However, if the object data is corrupt or has been marked as being permanently unavailable, the retrieval does not fail. Instead, the Archive Node continuously retries the retrieval and the value for Request Failures continues to increase.

This alarm can indicate that the storage media holding the requested data is corrupt. Check the external archival storage system to further diagnose the problem.

If you determine that the object data is no longer in the archive, the object will have to be removed from the StorageGRID system. For more information, contact technical support. Once the problem that triggered this alarm is addressed, reset the failures count. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > ARC > Retrieve > Configuration > Main, select Reset Request Failure Count and click Apply Changes.

To diagnose and correct this problem, contact technical support.

After the problem that triggered this alarm is addressed, reset the failures count. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > ARC > Retrieve > Configuration > Main, select Reset Verification Failure Count and click Apply Changes.

This alarm is triggered when one or more drives in a StorageGRID appliance has failed or is not optimal. Replace the drives as required. When a StorageGRID system is provisioned, the CMN service is allocated a fixed number of object identifiers. This alarm is triggered when the StorageGRID system begins to exhaust its supply of object identifiers.

To allocate more identifiers, contact technical support.
