a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Stop all services: service servermanager stop

Services can take up to 15 minutes to shut down, and you might want to log in to the system remotely to monitor the shutdown process.

3. If the node is running on a VMware virtual machine or it is an appliance node, issue the shutdown command: shutdown -h now

Perform this step regardless of the outcome of the service servermanager stop command.

After you issue the shutdown -h now command on an appliance node, you must power cycle the appliance to restart the node.

For the appliance, this command shuts down the controller, but the appliance is still powered on. You must complete the next step. 4. If you are powering down an appliance node, follow the steps for your appliance.

Power down host

Before you power down a host, you must stop services on all grid nodes on that host.

Steps

1. Log in to the grid node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

1502

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Stop all services running on the node: service servermanager stop

Services can take up to 15 minutes to shut down, and you might want to log in to the system remotely to monitor the shutdown process.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each node on the host.

4. If you have a Linux host: a. Log in to the host operating system.

b. Stop the node: storagegrid node stop c. Shut down the host operating system.

5. If the node is running on a VMware virtual machine or it is an appliance node, issue the shutdown command: shutdown -h now

Perform this step regardless of the outcome of the service servermanager stop command. b. Wait for the blue power LED to turn off.
