You must address the\nunderlying issue immediately. Service disruption and loss of data might\nresult if the issue is not resolved.\n• Major\n: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current\noperations or approaching the threshold for a critical alert. You should\ninvestigate major alerts and address any underlying issues to ensure that\nthe abnormal condition does not stop the normal operation of a\nStorageGRID node or service.\n• Minor\n: The system is operating normally, but an abnormal condition\nexists that could affect the system’s ability to operate if it continues. You\nshould monitor and resolve minor alerts that don’t clear on their own to\nensure they don’t result in a more serious problem.</td>
