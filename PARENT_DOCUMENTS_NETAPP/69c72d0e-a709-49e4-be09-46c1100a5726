Description

Current system alerts that indicate potential problems in the StorageGRID system.

Statistics based on the application user agents. For example, the number of PUT/GET/DELETE/HEAD operations per user agent and total bytes size of each operation. AutoSupport header data.

Configure AutoSupport

By default, the StorageGRID AutoSupport feature is enabled when you first install StorageGRID. However, you must configure hardware AutoSupport on each appliance. As needed, you can change the AutoSupport configuration.

If you want to change the configuration of StorageGRID AutoSupport, make your changes only on the primary Admin Node. You must configure hardware AutoSupport on each appliance.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Root access permission.

If you will use HTTPS for sending AutoSupport packages, you have provided outbound internet access to the primary Admin Node, either directly or using a proxy server (inbound connections not required).

If HTTP is selected on the StorageGRID AutoSupport page, you have configured a proxy server to forward AutoSupport packages as HTTPS. NetAppâ€™s AutoSupport servers will reject packages sent using HTTP. Learn about configuring admin proxy settings. Description
