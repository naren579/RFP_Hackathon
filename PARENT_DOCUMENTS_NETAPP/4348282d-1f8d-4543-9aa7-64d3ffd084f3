See What is a Storage Node?

Gateway Nodes (optional)

Provide a load-balancing interface that client applications can use to connect to StorageGRID. A load balancer seamlessly directs clients to an optimal Storage Node, so that the failure of nodes or even an entire site is transparent. See What is a Gateway Node?

Archive Nodes (deprecated)

Provide an optional interface through which object data can be archived to tape.

Hardware and software nodes

StorageGRID nodes can be deployed as StorageGRID appliance nodes or as software-based nodes. StorageGRID appliance nodes

StorageGRID hardware appliances are specially designed for use in a StorageGRID system. Some appliances can be used as Storage Nodes. Other appliances can be used as Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes. You can combine appliance nodes with software-based nodes or deploy fully engineered, all-appliance grids that have no dependencies on external hypervisors, storage, or compute hardware.

See the following to learn about the available appliances:

Software-based nodes

Software-based grid nodes can be deployed as VMware virtual machines or within container engines on a Linux host. See What is a Storage Node?

Software-based nodes

Software-based grid nodes can be deployed as VMware virtual machines or within container engines on a Linux host.

Virtual machine (VM) in VMware vSphere: See Install StorageGRID on VMware.

Within a container engine on Red Hat Enterprise Linux: See Install StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Within a container engine on Ubuntu or Debian: See Install StorageGRID on Ubuntu or Debian. Use the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) to determine the supported versions.

During initial installation of a new software-based Storage Node you can specify that it only be used to store metadata.

StorageGRID services

The following is a complete list of StorageGRID services.

Service

Description Location

Account Service Forwarder

Provides an interface for the Load Balancer service to query the Account Service on remote hosts and provides notifications of Load Balancer Endpoint configuration changes to the Load Balancer service.

Load Balancer service on Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes

ADC (Administrative Domain Controller)

Maintains topology information, provides authentication services, and responds to queries from the LDR and CMN services.

At least three Storage Nodes containing the ADC service at each site AMS (Audit Management System)

Monitors and logs all audited system events and transactions to a text log file.

Admin Nodes

ARC (Archive)

Provides the management interface with which you configure connections to external archival storage, such as the cloud through an S3 interface or tape through TSM middleware. Archive Nodes

Cassandra Reaper

Performs automatic repairs of object metadata.

Storage Nodes

Chunk service

Manages erasure-coded data and parity fragments.

Storage Nodes

CMN (Configuration Management Node)

Manages system-wide configurations and grid tasks. Each grid has one CMN service.

Primary Admin Node DDS (Distributed Data Store)

Interfaces with the Cassandra database to manage object metadata.

Service

DMV (Data Mover)

Dynamic IP (dynip)

Grafana

High Availability

Identity (idnt)

Lambda Arbitrator

Load Balancer (nginx-gw)

LDR (Local Distribution Router)

MISCd Information Service Control Daemon nginx

nginx-gw

NMS (Network Management System)

Description

Moves data to cloud endpoints.

Monitors the grid for dynamic IP changes and updates local configurations.

Used for metrics visualization in the Grid Manager.
