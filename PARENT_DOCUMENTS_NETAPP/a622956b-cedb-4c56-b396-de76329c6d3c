This procedure is only for configuring a StorageGRID proxy server for E-Series AutoSupport packages. For additional details on E-Series AutoSupport configuration, see the NetApp E- Series and SANtricity Documentation. Steps

1. In the Grid Manager, select NODES.

2. From the list of nodes on the left, select the storage appliance node you want to configure.

3. Select SANtricity System Manager. Before you begin

You are signed into the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Storage appliance administrator or Root access permission.

You have configured SANtricity AutoSupport: For SG6000 and SG5700 appliances, configure AutoSupport in SANtricity System Manager

You must have SANtricity firmware 8.70 or higher to access SANtricity System Manager using the Grid Manager.

About this task

E-Series AutoSupport packages contain details of the storage hardware and are more specific than other AutoSupport packages sent by the StorageGRID system.

You can configure a special proxy server address in SANtricity System Manager to transmit AutoSupport packages through a StorageGRID Admin Node without the use of the appliance’s management port. AutoSupport packages transmitted in this way are sent by the preferred sender Admin Node, and they use any admin proxy settings that have been configured in the Grid Manager.

This procedure is only for configuring a StorageGRID proxy server for E-Series AutoSupport packages. For additional details on E-Series AutoSupport configuration, see the NetApp E- Series and SANtricity Documentation. Steps

1. In the Grid Manager, select NODES.

2. From the list of nodes on the left, select the storage appliance node you want to configure.

3. Select SANtricity System Manager.

The SANtricity System Manager home page appears.

542

4. Select SUPPORT > Support center > AutoSupport.

The AutoSupport operations page appears.

543

5. Select Configure AutoSupport Delivery Method. The Configure AutoSupport Delivery Method page appears.

544

6. Select HTTPS for the delivery method.

The certificate that enables HTTPS is pre-installed.

7. Select via Proxy server.

8. Enter tunnel-host for the Host address.

tunnel-host is the special address to use an Admin Node to send E-Series AutoSupport packages.

9. Enter 10225 for the Port number.

10225 is the port number on the StorageGRID proxy server that receives AutoSupport packages from the E-Series controller in the appliance.

10. Select Test Configuration to test the routing and configuration of your AutoSupport proxy server.

If correct, a message in a green banner appears: "Your AutoSupport configuration has been verified."

If the test fails, an error message appears in a red banner. Check your StorageGRID DNS settings and

545

networking, ensure the preferred sender Admin Node can connect to the NetApp Support Site, and try the test again.

11. Select Save. The configuration is saved, and a confirmation message appears: "AutoSupport delivery method has been configured."

Manage Storage Nodes

Manage Storage Nodes: Overview

Storage Nodes provide disk storage capacity and services. Managing Storage Nodes entails the following:

Managing storage options

Understanding what storage volume watermarks are and how you can use watermark overrides to control when Storage Nodes become read-only

Monitoring and managing the space used for object metadata

Configuring global settings for stored objects

Applying Storage Node configuration settings

Managing full Storage Nodes Use Storage options

What is object segmentation?

Object segmentation is the process of splitting up an object into a collection of smaller fixed-size objects to optimize storage and resources usage for large objects. S3 multi-part upload also creates segmented objects, with an object representing each part.

When an object is ingested into the StorageGRID system, the LDR service splits the object into segments, and creates a segment container that lists the header information of all segments as content.

546

On retrieval of a segment container, the LDR service assembles the original object from its segments and returns the object to the client.

The container and segments aren’t necessarily stored on the same Storage Node. Container and segments can be stored on any Storage Node within the storage pool specified in the ILM rule. Each segment is treated by the StorageGRID system independently and contributes to the count of attributes such as Managed Objects and Stored Objects. For example, if an object stored to the StorageGRID system is split into two segments, the value of Managed Objects increases by three after the ingest is complete, as follows:

segment container + segment 1 + segment 2 = three stored objects
