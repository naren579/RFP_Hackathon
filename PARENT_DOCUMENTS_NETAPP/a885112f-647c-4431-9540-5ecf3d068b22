1. Select Action > Copy to create a copy of the initial SP connection for each additional Admin Node.

2. Enter the Connection ID and Connection Name for the copy, and select Save.

Disable single sign-on

You can disable single sign-on (SSO) if you no longer want to use this functionality. You must disable single sign-on before you can disable identity federation.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. Steps

2. Select the Disabled option.

3. Select Save.

A warning message appears indicating that local users will now be able to sign in.

4. Select OK.

The next time you sign in to StorageGRID, the StorageGRID Sign in page appears and you must enter the username and password for a local or federated StorageGRID user. Temporarily disable and reenable single sign-on for one Admin Node

You might not be able to sign in to the Grid Manager if the single sign-on (SSO) system goes down. In this case, you can temporarily disable and reenable SSO for one Admin Node. To disable and then reenable SSO, you must access the node’s command shell.

Before you begin

You have specific access permissions.

You have the Passwords.txt file.

You know the password for the local root user. About this task

After you disable SSO for one Admin Node, you can sign in to the Grid Manager as the local root user. To secure your StorageGRID system, you must use the node’s command shell to reenable SSO on the Admin Node as soon as you sign out.

Disabling SSO for one Admin Node does not affect the SSO settings for any other Admin Nodes in the grid. The Enable SSO checkbox on the Single Sign-on page in the Grid Manager remains selected, and all existing SSO settings are maintained unless you update them. Steps

1. Log in to an Admin Node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.
