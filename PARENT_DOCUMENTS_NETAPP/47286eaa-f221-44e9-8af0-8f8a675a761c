Plan and prepare for installation on Red Hat

Required information and materials

Before you install StorageGRID, gather and prepare the required information and materials.

Required information Network plan

Which networks you intend to attach to each StorageGRID node. StorageGRID supports multiple networks for traffic separation, security, and administrative convenience.

See the StorageGRID Networking guidelines.

Network information

Unless you are using DHCP, IP addresses to assign to each grid node and the IP addresses of the DNS and NTP servers. Servers for grid nodes

Identify a set of servers (physical, virtual, or both) that, in aggregate, provide sufficient resources to support the number and type of StorageGRID nodes you plan to deploy.

If your StorageGRID installation will not use StorageGRID appliance (hardware) Storage Nodes, you must use hardware RAID storage with battery-backed write cache (BBWC). StorageGRID does not support the use of virtual storage area networks (vSANs), software RAID, or no RAID protection.

Node migration (if needed)

Understand the requirements for node migration, if you want to perform scheduled maintenance on physical hosts without any service interruption.
