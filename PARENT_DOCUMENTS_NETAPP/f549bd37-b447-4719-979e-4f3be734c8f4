Process plain or compressed audit logs. For example:

audit-explain audit.log

audit-explain 2019-08-12.txt.gz

Process multiple files simultaneously. For example:

audit-explain audit.log 2019-08-12.txt.gz 2019-08-13.txt.gz

audit-explain /var/local/log/*

Accept input from a pipe, which allows you to filter and preprocess the input using the grep command or other means. For example:

grep SPUT audit.log | audit-explain grep bucket-name audit.log | audit-explain

Because audit logs can be very large and slow to parse, you can save time by filtering parts that you want to look at and running audit-explain on the parts, instead of the entire file.

The audit-explain tool does not accept compressed files as piped input. To process compressed files, provide their file names as command-line arguments, or use the zcat tool to decompress the files first. For example: zcat audit.log.gz | audit-explain

Use the help (-h) option to see the available options. For example:

$ audit-explain -h

Steps

1. Log in to the primary Admin Node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@primary_Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Enter the following command, where /var/local/log/audit.log represents the name and the location of the file or files you want to analyze: $ audit-explain /var/local/log/audit.log

The audit-explain tool prints human-readable interpretations of all messages in the specified file or files.

To reduce line lengths and to aid readability, timestamps aren’t shown by default. If you want to see the timestamps, use the timestamp (-t) option. Use audit-sum tool Use the help (-h) option to see the available options. For example:

$ audit-explain -h

You can use the audit-sum tool to count the write, read, head, and delete audit messages and to see the minimum, maximum, and average time (or size) for each operation type.

Before you begin

You have specific access permissions.

You must have the Passwords.txt file.

You must know the IP address of the primary Admin Node. About this task

The audit-sum tool, available on the primary Admin Node, summarizes how many write, read, and delete operations were logged and how long these operations took.

1314

The audit-sum tool is primarily intended for use by technical support during troubleshooting operations. Processing audit-sum queries can consume a large amount of CPU power, which might impact StorageGRID operations.

This example shows typical output from the audit-sum tool. This example shows how long protocol operations took.
