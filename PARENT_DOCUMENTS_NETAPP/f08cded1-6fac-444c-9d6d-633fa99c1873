2. Enter the provisioning passphrase, and select Start download.

The download starts immediately.

3. When the download completes, open the .zip file and confirm that you can access the contents, including the Passwords.txt file.

4. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (.zip) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system. Decommission nodes or site

Decommission procedure: Overview

You can perform a decommission procedure to permanently remove grid nodes or an entire site from the StorageGRID system.

To remove a grid node or a site, you perform one of the following decommission procedures:

Perform a grid node decommission to remove one or more nodes, which can be at one or more sites. The nodes you remove can be online and connected to the StorageGRID system, or they can be offline and disconnected.

Perform a site decommission to remove a site. You perform a connected site decommission if all nodes are connected to StorageGRID. You perform a disconnected site decommission if all nodes are disconnected from StorageGRID. If the site contains a mixture of connected and disconnected nodes, you must bring all offline nodes back online. Before performing a disconnected site decommission, contact your NetApp account representative. NetApp will review your requirements before enabling all steps in the Decommission Site wizard. You should not attempt a disconnected site decommission if you believe it might be possible to recover the site or to recover object data from the site. Decommission nodes

Grid node decommission: Overview

You can use the node decommission procedure to remove one or more grid nodes at one or more sites. You can’t decommission the primary Admin Node.

When to decommission a node

Use the node decommission procedure when any of the following are true:

You added a larger Storage Node in an expansion and you want to remove one or more smaller Storage Nodes, while at the same time preserving objects.

If you want to replace an older appliance with a newer appliance, consider cloning the appliance node instead of adding a new appliance in an expansion and then decommissioning the old appliance.

You require less total storage.

You no longer require a Gateway Node.

You no longer require a non-primary Admin Node.

Your grid includes a disconnected node that you can’t recover or bring back online.

• Your grid includes an Archive Node.

How to decommission a node

You can decommission connected grid nodes or disconnected grid nodes. Decommission connected nodes

In general, you should decommission grid nodes only when they are connected to the StorageGRID system and only when all nodes are in normal health (have green icons on the NODES pages and on the Decommission Nodes page).

For instructions, see Decommission connected grid nodes.

Decommission disconnected nodes

In some cases, you might need to decommission a grid node that is not currently connected to the grid (one whose Health is Unknown or Administratively Down). For example, you can only decommission an Archive Node if it is disconnected.

For instructions, see Decommission disconnected grid nodes.

What to consider before decommissioning a node

Before performing either procedure, review the considerations for each type of node:

Considerations for Admin, Gateway, or Archive Node decommission

Considerations for Storage Node decommission Considerations for decommissioning Admin, Gateway, or Archive Nodes

Review the considerations for decommissioning an Admin Node, Gateway Node, or Archive Node. Considerations for Admin Node

You can’t decommission the primary Admin Node.

You can’t decommission an Admin Node if one of its network interfaces is part of a high availability (HA) group. You must first remove the network interfaces from the HA group. See the instructions for managing HA groups.
