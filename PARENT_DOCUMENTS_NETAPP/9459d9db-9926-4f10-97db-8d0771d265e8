Use Swift REST API: Overview

Client applications can use the OpenStack Swift API to interface with the StorageGRID system.

Support for Swift client applications has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

StorageGRID supports the following specific versions of Swift and HTTP. Item

Version

Swift specification

OpenStack Swift Object Storage API v1 as of November 2015

HTTP

1.1 For more information about HTTP, see HTTP/1.1 (RFCs 7230-35).

Note: StorageGRID does not support HTTP/1.1 pipelining.

Comments

11.8

11.7

Support for Swift client applications has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

11.6

Minor editorial changes.

11.5

Removed Weak consistency. The Available consistency will be used instead.

11.4

Added support for TLS 1.3. Added description of interrelationship between ILM and consistency.

11.3

Updated PUT Object operations to describe the impact of ILM rules that use synchronous placement at ingest (the Balanced and Strict options for Ingest Behavior). Added description of client connections that use load balancer endpoints or high availability groups. TLS 1.1 ciphers are no longer supported.

11.2 Minor editorial changes to document.

11.1

Added support for using HTTP for Swift client connections to grid nodes. Updated the definitions of consistency values.

11.0

Added support for 1,000 containers for each tenant account.

10.3

Administrative updates and corrections to the document. Removed sections for configuring custom server certificates.

10.2

Initial support of the Swift API by the StorageGRID system. The currently supported version is OpenStack Swift Object Storage API v1. How StorageGRID implements Swift REST API

A client application can use Swift REST API calls to connect to Storage Nodes and Gateway Nodes to create containers and to store and retrieve objects. This enables service-oriented applications developed for OpenStack Swift to connect with on-premise object storage provided by the StorageGRID system.

Swift object management

After Swift objects have been ingested in the StorageGRID system, they are managed by the information lifecycle management (ILM) rules in the active ILM policies. ILM rules and ILM policies determine how

994

StorageGRID creates and distributes copies of object data and how it manages those copies over time. For example, an ILM rule might apply to objects in specific Swift containers and might specify that multiple object copies be saved to several data centers for a certain number of years. Contact your NetApp Professional Services consultant or StorageGRID administrator if you need to understand how the grid’s ILM rules and policies will affect the objects in your Swift tenant account.

Conflicting client requests

Conflicting client requests, such as two clients writing to the same key, are resolved on a "latest-wins" basis. The timing for the "latest-wins" evaluation is based on when the StorageGRID system completes a given request, and not on when Swift clients begin an operation. Consistency guarantees and controls A client application can use Swift REST API calls to connect to Storage Nodes and Gateway Nodes to create containers and to store and retrieve objects.
