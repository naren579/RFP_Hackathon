You must recover an Admin Node as soon as possible to restore logging functionality.

By default, audit information is sent to the audit log on Admin Nodes. You can skip these steps if either of the following applies: You configured an external syslog server and audit logs are now being sent to the syslog server instead of to Admin Nodes.

You explicitly specified that audit messages should be saved only on the local nodes that generated them.

See Configure audit messages and log destinations for details.

Steps

1. Log in to the recovered Admin Node: a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@recovery_Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

1621

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

After you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Check which audit files have been preserved: cd /var/local/log If there is only one Admin Node and the audit log can’t be copied from the failed node, the recovered Admin Node starts recording events to the audit log as if the installation is new.

2. Check which audit files have been preserved: cd /var/local/log

3. Copy the preserved audit log files to the recovered Admin Node: scp admin@ grid_node_IP:/var/local/tmp/saved-audit-logs/YYYY* .

When prompted, enter the password for admin.

4. For security, delete the audit logs from the failed grid node after verifying that they have been copied successfully to the recovered Admin Node.

5. Update the user and group settings of the audit log files on the recovered Admin Node: chown ams- user: bycast *

6. Log out as root: exit

You must also restore any pre-existing client access to the audit share. For more information, see Configure audit client access. Restore Admin Node database when recovering primary Admin Node

If you want to retain the historical information about attributes, alarms, and alerts on a primary Admin Node that has failed, you can restore the Admin Node database. You can only restore this database if your StorageGRID system includes another Admin Node.

Before you begin

The recovered Admin Node is installed and running.

The StorageGRID system includes at least two Admin Nodes.

You have the Passwords.txt file.

You have the provisioning passphrase. About this task

If an Admin Node fails, the historical information stored in its Admin Node database is lost. This database includes the following information:

Alert history

Alarm history

Historical attribute data, which is used in the charts and text reports available from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page.

When you recover an Admin Node, the software installation process creates an empty Admin Node database on the recovered node. However, the new database only includes information for servers and services that are currently part of the system or added later.

If you restored a primary Admin Node and your StorageGRID system has another Admin Node, you can restore the historical information by copying the Admin Node database from a non-primary Admin Node (the source Admin Node) to the recovered primary Admin Node. If your system has only a primary Admin Node, you can’t restore the Admin Node database.

1622 Copying the Admin Node database might take several hours. Some Grid Manager features will be unavailable while services are stopped on the source Admin Node.

Steps

1. Log in to the source Admin Node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

2. From the source Admin Node, stop the MI service: service mi stop

3. From the source Admin Node, stop the Management Application Program Interface (mgmt-api) service: service mgmt-api stop

4. Complete the following steps on the recovered Admin Node:

a. Log in to the recovered Admin Node:

i. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

ii. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.
