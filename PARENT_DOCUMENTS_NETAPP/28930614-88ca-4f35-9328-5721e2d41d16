Recommended action

Check for connectivity issues.

Check system activity to confirm that there is an increase in system activity. An increase in system activity will result in an increase to attribute data activity. This increased activity will result in a delay to the processing of attribute data. This can be normal system activity and will subside.

Check for multiple alarms. An increase in average latency times can be indicated by an excessive number of triggered alarms.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of LDR State is Standby, continue monitoring the situation and if the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of LDR State is Offline, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support. Triggered when the StorageGRID system fails to retrieve a copy of the requested object from anywhere in the system. Before a LOST (Lost Objects) alarm is triggered, the system attempts to retrieve and replace a missing object from elsewhere in the system.

Lost objects represent a loss of data. The Lost Objects attribute is incremented whenever the number of locations for an object drops to zero without the DDS service purposely purging the content to satisfy the ILM policy.

Investigate LOST (LOST Object) alarms immediately. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

Troubleshoot lost and missing object data

Triggered when the certificate used for accessing the management interface is about to expire.

1. From the Grid Manager, select CONFIGURATION > Security > Certificates.

2. On the Global tab, select Management interface certificate.

3. Upload a new management interface certificate.

Check the network connections of the servers hosting the NMS service and the external mail server. Also confirm that the email server configuration is correct. Configure email server settings for alarms (legacy system)

A minor alarm is triggered if the NMS service is unable to connect to the mail server. Check the network connections of the servers hosting the NMS service and the external mail server. Also confirm that the email server configuration is correct. Configure email server settings for alarms (legacy system)

An alarm is triggered if the NMS interface engine on the Admin Node that gathers and generates interface content is disconnected from the system. Check Server Manager to determine if the server individual application is down.

Check the network adapter configuration. The setting must match preferences of your network routers and switches.

An incorrect setting can have a severe impact on system performance.
