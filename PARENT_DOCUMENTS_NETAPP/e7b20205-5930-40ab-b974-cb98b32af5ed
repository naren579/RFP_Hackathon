Use these troubleshooting guidelines if you see any of the following error messages when attempting to sign in to an Admin Node:

Your credentials for this account were invalid. Please try again.

Waiting for services to start…

Internal server error. The server encountered an error and could not complete your request. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact Technical Support.

Unable to communicate with server. Reloading page… Steps

1. Wait 10 minutes, and try signing in again.

If the error is not resolved automatically, go to the next step.

2. If your StorageGRID system has more than one Admin Node, try signing in to the Grid Manager from another Admin Node. Troubleshoot Admin Node and user interface issues

There are several tasks you can perform to help determine the source of issues related to Admin Nodes and the StorageGRID user interface.

Sign-on errors

If you experience an error when you are signing in to a StorageGRID Admin Node, your system might have an issue with the identity federation configuration, a networking or hardware problem, an issue with Admin Node services, or an issue with the Cassandra database on connected Storage Nodes.

2. If your StorageGRID system has more than one Admin Node, try signing in to the Grid Manager from another Admin Node.

If you are able to sign in, you can use the Dashboard, NODES, Alerts, and SUPPORT options to help determine the cause of the error.

If you have only one Admin Node or you still can’t sign in, go to the next step.

3. Determine if the node’s hardware is offline.

4. If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, refer to the steps for configuring single sign-on.

1291

You might need to temporarily disable and re-enable SSO for a single Admin Node to resolve any issues.

If SSO is enabled, you can’t sign on using a restricted port. You must use port 443.

5. Determine if the account you are using belongs to a federated user. If the federated user account is not working, try signing in to the Grid Manager as a local user, such as root.

If the local user can sign in:

i. Review any displayed alarms.

ii. Select CONFIGURATION > Access Control > Identity federation.

iii. Click Test Connection to validate your connection settings for the LDAP server.

iv. If the test fails, resolve any configuration errors.

If the local user can’t sign in and you are confident that the credentials are correct, go to the next step.

6. Use Secure Shell (ssh) to log in to the Admin Node: a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

7. View the status of all services running on the grid node: storagegrid-status

Make sure the nms, mi, nginx, and mgmt api services are all running.

The output is updated immediately if the status of a service changes. 5. Determine if the account you are using belongs to a federated user. If the federated user account is not working, try signing in to the Grid Manager as a local user, such as root.
