For any existing traffic classification policy, you can view metrics for the load balancer service to determine if the policy is successfully limiting traffic across the network. The data in the graphs can help you determine if you need to adjust the policy.

Even if no limits are set for a traffic classification policy, metrics are collected and the graphs provide useful information for understanding traffic trends. Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Network > Traffic classification.

The Traffic classification policies page appears, and the existing policies are listed in the table.

2. Select the traffic classification policy name for which you want to view metrics.

3. Select the Metrics tab.

The traffic classification policy graphs appear. The graphs display metrics only for the traffic that matches the selected policy.

The following graphs are included on the page.
