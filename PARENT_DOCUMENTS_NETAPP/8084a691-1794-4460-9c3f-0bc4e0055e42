Enabling MAC cloning on a virtual host without also enabling promiscuous mode on the hypervisor might cause Linux host networking using the host’s interface to stop working.

MAC cloning use cases

There are two use cases to consider with MAC cloning: MAC cloning not enabled: When the _CLONE_MAC key in the node configuration file is not set, or set to "false," the host will use the host NIC MAC and the container will have a StorageGRID-generated MAC unless a MAC is specified in the _NETWORK_MAC key. If an address is set in the _NETWORK_MAC key, the container will have the address specified in the _NETWORK_MAC key. This configuration of keys requires the use of promiscuous mode.

MAC cloning enabled: When the _CLONE_MAC key in the node configuration file is set to "true," the container uses the host NIC MAC, and the host uses a StorageGRID-generated MAC unless a MAC is specified in the _NETWORK_MAC key. If an address is set in the _NETWORK_MAC key, the host uses the specified address instead of a generated one. In this configuration of keys, you should not use promiscuous mode. If you don’t want to use MAC address cloning and would rather allow all interfaces to receive and transmit data for MAC addresses other than the ones assigned by the hypervisor, ensure that the security properties at the virtual switch and port group levels are set to Accept for Promiscuous Mode, MAC Address Changes, and Forged Transmits. The values set on the virtual switch can be overridden by the values at the port group level, so ensure that settings are the same in both places.

To enable MAC cloning, see the instructions for creating node configuration files.

MAC cloning example

Example of MAC cloning enabled with a host having MAC address of 11:22:33:44:55:66 for the interface ens256 and the following keys in the node configuration file:

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET = ens256

ADMIN_NETWORK_MAC = b2:9c:02:c2:27:10

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC = true

Result: the host MAC for ens256 is b2:9c:02:c2:27:10 and the Admin Network MAC is 11:22:33:44:55:66 89

Example 1: 1-to-1 mapping to physical or virtual NICs

Example 1 describes a simple physical interface mapping that requires little or no host-side configuration. To enable MAC cloning, see the instructions for creating node configuration files.

Example 1: 1-to-1 mapping to physical or virtual NICs

Example 1 describes a simple physical interface mapping that requires little or no host-side configuration.

The Linux operating system creates the ensXYZ interfaces automatically during installation or boot, or when the interfaces are hot-added. No configuration is required other than ensuring that the interfaces are set to come up automatically after boot. You do have to determine which ensXYZ corresponds to which StorageGRID network (Grid, Admin, or Client) so you can provide the correct mappings later in the configuration process.

Note that the figure show multiple StorageGRID nodes; however, you would normally use this configuration for single-node VMs.

If Switch 1 is a physical switch, you should configure the ports connected to interfaces 10G1 through 10G3 for access mode, and place them on the appropriate VLANs.

Example 2: LACP bond carrying VLANs About this task

Example 2 assumes you are familiar with bonding network interfaces and with creating VLAN interfaces on the Linux distribution you are using.

Example 2 describes a generic, flexible, VLAN-based scheme that facilitates the sharing of all available network bandwidth across all nodes on a single host. This example is particularly applicable to bare metal hosts.

To understand this example, suppose you have three separate subnets for the Grid, Admin, and Client Networks at each data center. The subnets are on separate VLANs (1001, 1002, and 1003) and are presented to the host on a LACP-bonded trunk port (bond0). You would configure three VLAN interfaces on the bond: bond0.1001, bond0.1002, and bond0.1003.

If you require separate VLANs and subnets for node networks on the same host, you can add VLAN interfaces on the bond and map them into the host (shown as bond0.1004 in the illustration).

90 Steps

1. Aggregate all physical network interfaces that will be used for StorageGRID network connectivity into a single LACP bond.

Use the same name for the bond on every host. For example, bond0.

2. Create VLAN interfaces that use this bond as their associated "physical device," using the standard VLAN interface naming convention physdev-name.VLAN ID.
