The service’s status can be listed as Not\nRunning for the following reasons:\n• The service has been manually stopped\n(/etc/init.d/&lt;service\&gt; stop).\n• There is an issue with the MySQL database and\nServer Manager shuts down the MI service.\n• A grid node has been added, but not started.\n• During installation, a grid node has not yet\nconnected to the Admin Node.\nIf a service is listed as Not Running, restart the\nservice (/etc/init.d/&lt;service\&gt; restart).\nThis alarm might also indicate that the metadata store\n(Cassandra database) for a Storage Node requires\nrebuilding.\nIf the problem persists, contact technical support.\nTroubleshoot the Services: Status - Cassandra\n(SVST) alarm</td>
