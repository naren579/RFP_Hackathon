3. To view details for a specific bucket, select the bucket name from the table.

The bucket details page appears. From this page, you can perform the following tasks if you have the required permissions:

Configure and manage bucket options:

▪ ILM policy tags ▪ Manage bucket consistency ▪ Last access time updates ▪ Object versioning ▪ S3 Object Lock ▪ Default bucket retention Configure bucket access, such as cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) ◦ Manage platform services (if allowed for the tenant), including CloudMirror replication, event notifications, and search integration

Enable and manage cross-grid replication (if allowed for the tenant) to replicate objects ingested into this bucket to another StorageGRID system

Access the S3 Console to manage the objects in the bucket ◦ Delete all objects in a bucket ◦ Delete a bucket that is already empty Apply an ILM policy tag to a bucket

Choose an ILM policy tag to apply to a bucket based on your object storage requirements.

The ILM policy controls where the object data is stored and whether it is deleted after a certain time period. Your grid administrator creates ILM policies and assigns them to ILM policy tags when using multiple active policies.

Avoid frequently reassigning a bucket’s policy tag. Otherwise, performance issues might occur.
