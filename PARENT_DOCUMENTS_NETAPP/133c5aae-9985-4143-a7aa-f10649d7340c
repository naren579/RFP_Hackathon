Any objects ingested into the source bucket after you remove the Use grid federation connection permission will never be replicated to the destination bucket. Steps

1. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.

2. Select CONFIGURATION > System > Grid federation.

3. Select the connection name to display its details page.

4. On the Permitted tenants tab, select radio button for the tenant.

5. Select Remove permission.

6. Review the warnings in the confirmation dialog box, and select Force remove.

A success message appears. This tenant can no longer use the grid federation connection.

7. As required, go to the other grid and repeat these steps to force-remove the permission for the same tenant account on the other grid. For example, you should repeat these steps on the other grid to prevent in-process objects from reaching the destination bucket. Troubleshoot grid federation errors

You might need to troubleshoot alerts and errors related to grid federation connections, account clone, and cross-grid replication.

Grid federation connection alerts and errors

You might receive alerts or experience errors with your grid federation connections.

After making any changes to resolve a connection issue, test the connection to ensure that the connection status returns to Connected. For instructions, see Manage grid federation connections. Grid federation connection failure alert

This alert indicates that the grid federation connection between the grids is not working.

Recommended actions

1. Review the settings on the Grid Federation page for both grids. Confirm that all values are correct. See Manage grid federation connections.

2. Review the certificates used for the connection. Make sure there are no alerts for expired grid federation certificates and that the details for each certificate are valid. See the instructions for rotating connection certificates in Manage grid federation connections.

3. Confirm that all Admin and Gateway Nodes in both grids are online and available. Resolve any alerts that might be affecting these nodes and try again.

Error editing a grid federation connection Issue

When editing a grid federation connection, you see the following warning message when you select Save and test: "Failed to create a candidate configuration file on one or more nodes."

Details

When you edit a grid federation connection, StorageGRID attempts to save a "candidate configuration" file on all Admin Nodes on the first grid. A warning message appears if this file canâ€™t be saved to all Admin Nodes, for example, because an Admin Node is offline.

Recommended actions

1. From the grid you are using to edit the connection, select NODES.

2. Confirm that all Admin Nodes for that grid are online.

3. If any nodes are offline, bring them back online and try editing the connection again. Account clone errors
