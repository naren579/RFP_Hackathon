See Configure the SNMP agent for details about each field on the SNMP agent page. You must select Save at the bottom of the page to commit any changes you make on each tab. Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Monitoring > SNMP agent.

The SNMP agent page appears.

2. To disable the SNMP agent on all grid nodes, clear the Enable SNMP checkbox, and select Save.

If you re-enable the SNMP agent, any previous SNMP configuration settings are retained.

3. Optionally, update the information in the Basic configuration section:

a. As required, update the System contact and System location.

b. Optionally, select or clear the Enable SNMP agent notifications checkbox to control whether the

StorageGRID SNMP agent sends trap and inform notifications.

When this checkbox is cleared, the SNMP agent supports read-only MIB access, but it doesn’t send SNMP notifications.

c. Optionally, select or clear the Enable authentication traps checkbox to control whether the

StorageGRID SNMP agent sends authentication traps when it receives improperly authenticated protocol messages. 4. If you use SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, optionally update or add a Read-only community in the Community strings section.

5. To update trap destinations, select the Trap destinations tab in the Other configurations section.

Use this tab to define one or more destinations for StorageGRID trap or inform notifications. When you enable the SNMP agent and select Save, StorageGRID sends notifications to each defined destination when alerts are triggered. Standard notifications are also sent for the supported MIB-II entities (for example, ifDown and coldStart).

For details about what to enter, see Create trap destinations.

Optionally, update or remove the default trap community.

If you remove the default trap community, you must first ensure that any existing trap destinations use a custom community string.

Use this tab to specify one or more "listening addresses." These are the StorageGRID addresses on which the SNMP agent can receive queries.

For details about what to enter, see Create agent addresses.
