Display charts and graphs

The Nodes page contains the charts and graphs you should access regularly to monitor attributes such as storage capacity and throughput. In some cases, especially when working with technical support, you can use the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page to access additional charts.

There are two types of reports generated depending on the time period you are reporting on: raw text reports for periods less than a week, and aggregate text reports for time periods greater than a week. Raw text reports

A raw text report displays details about the selected attribute:
