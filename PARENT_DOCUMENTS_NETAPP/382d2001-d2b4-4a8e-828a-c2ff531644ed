How grid nodes discover the primary Admin Node

Note: This value is ignored, and might be prohibited, on the primary Admin Node.

ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG

Value

Designation

DHCP, STATIC, or DISABLED

Optional

ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL

Value

Designation

Comma-separated list of subnets in CIDR notation to which this node should communicate using the Admin Network gateway. Optional

Example: 172.16.0.0/21,172.17.0.0/21

165

ADMIN_NETWORK_GATEWAY

Value

IPv4 address of the local Admin Network gateway for this node. Must be on the subnet defined by ADMIN_NETWORK_IP and ADMIN_NETWORK_MASK. This value is ignored for DHCP-configured networks.

Examples:

1.1.1.1

10.224.4.81 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP

Examples:

1.1.1.1

10.224.4.81 ADMIN_NETWORK_IP

Value

IPv4 address of this node on the Admin Network. This key is only required when ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC; don’t specify it for other values.

Examples:

1.1.1.1

10.224.4.81

ADMIN_NETWORK_MAC

Value

The MAC address for the Admin Network interface in the container.

This field is optional. If omitted, a MAC address will be generated automatically.

Must be 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

Example: b2:9c:02:c2:27:10 ADMIN_NETWORK_MASK

Value

166

Designation

Required if ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL is specified. Optional otherwise.

Designation

Required when ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.

Designation

Optional

Designation

IPv4 netmask for this node, on the Admin Network. Specify this key when ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC; don’t specify it for other values. Examples:

255.255.255.0

255.255.248.0

ADMIN_NETWORK_MTU

Value

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for this node on the Admin Network. Don’t specify if ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = DHCP. If specified, the value must be between 1280 and 9216. If omitted, 1500 is used.

If you want to use jumbo frames, set the MTU to a value suitable for jumbo frames, such as 9000. Otherwise, keep the default value.

IMPORTANT: The MTU value of the network must match the value configured on the switch port the node is connected to. Otherwise, network performance issues or packet loss might occur. Examples:

1500

8192

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET

Value

Required if ADMIN_NETWORK_IP is specified and ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.

Designation

Optional

Designation

167

Name of the host device that you will use for Admin Network access by the StorageGRID node. Only network interface names are supported. Typically, you use a different interface name than what was specified for GRID_NETWORK_TARGET or CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET.

Note: Don’t use bond or bridge devices as the network target. Either configure a VLAN (or other virtual interface) on top of the bond device, or use a bridge and virtual Ethernet (veth) pair.

Best practice:Specify a value even if this node will not initially have an Admin Network IP address. Then you can add an Admin Network IP address later, without having to reconfigure the node on the host. Examples:

bond0.1002

ens256

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE

Value

Interface (This is the only supported value.)

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC

Value

True or False

Set the key to "true" to cause the StorageGRID container use the MAC address of the host host target interface on the Admin Network. Value

Required if ADMIN_NETWORK_IP is specified and ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.
