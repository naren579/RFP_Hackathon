AutoSupport for appliances reports StorageGRID hardware issues, and StorageGRID AutoSupport reports StorageGRID software issues, with one exception: for the SGF6112, StorageGRID AutoSupport reports both hardware and software issues. You must configure AutoSupport on each appliance except the SGF6112, which does not require additional configuration. AutoSupport is implemented differently for services appliances and storage appliances.

You use SANtricity to enable AutoSupport for each storage appliance. You can configure SANtricity AutoSupport during initial appliance setup or after an appliance has been installed:

For SG6000 and SG5700 appliances, configure AutoSupport in SANtricity System Manager

AutoSupport packages from E-Series appliances can be included in StorageGRID AutoSupport if you configure AutoSupport delivery by proxy in SANtricity System Manager. StorageGRID AutoSupport does not report hardware issues, such as DIMM or host interface card (HIC) faults. However, some component failures might trigger hardware alerts. For StorageGRID appliances with a baseboard management controller (BMC) you can configure email and SNMP traps to report hardware failures:

Set up email notifications for BMC alerts

Configure SNMP settings for BMC

Manually trigger an AutoSupport package

To assist technical support in troubleshooting issues with your StorageGRID system, you can manually trigger an AutoSupport package to be sent.

Before you begin

You must have the Root access or Other grid configuration permission. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > AutoSupport.

2. On the Actions tab, select Send User-Triggered AutoSupport.

540

StorageGRID attempts to send an AutoSupport package to the NetApp Support Site. If the attempt is successful, the Most Recent Result and Last Successful Time values on the Results tab are updated. If there is a problem, the Most Recent Result value updates to "Failed," and StorageGRID does not try to send the AutoSupport package again.

After sending an User-triggered AutoSupport package, refresh the AutoSupport page in your browser after 1 minute to access the most recent results. Troubleshoot AutoSupport packages

If an attempt to send an AutoSupport package fails, the StorageGRID system takes different actions depending on the type of AutoSupport package. You can check the status of AutoSupport packages by selecting SUPPORT > Tools > AutoSupport > Results.

When the AutoSupport package fails to send, "Failed" appears on the Results tab of the AutoSupport page.

If you configured a proxy server to forward AutoSupport packages to NetApp, you should verify that the proxy server configuration settings are correct. Weekly AutoSupport package failure

If a weekly AutoSupport package fails to send, the StorageGRID system takes the following actions:

1. Updates the Most Recent Result attribute to Retrying.

2. Attempts to resend the AutoSupport package 15 times every four minutes for one hour.

3. After one hour of send failures, updates the Most Recent Result attribute to Failed.

4. Attempts to send an AutoSupport package again at the next scheduled time. After sending an User-triggered AutoSupport package, refresh the AutoSupport page in your browser after 1 minute to access the most recent results. Troubleshoot AutoSupport packages
