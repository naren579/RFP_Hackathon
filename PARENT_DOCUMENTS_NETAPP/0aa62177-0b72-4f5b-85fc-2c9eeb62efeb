Disable alarms (legacy system)

The alarms in the legacy alarm system are enabled by default, but you can disable alarms that aren’t required. You can also disable the legacy alarms after you have completely transitioned to the new alert system.

While the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the alert system offers significant benefits and is easier to use.

Disable a Default alarm (legacy system)

You can disable one of the legacy Default alarms for the entire system.

Disabling an alarm for an attribute that currently has an alarm triggered does not clear the current alarm. The alarm will be disabled the next time the attribute crosses the alarm threshold, or you can clear the triggered alarm.

Don’t disable any of the legacy alarms until you have completely transitioned to the new alert system. Otherwise, you might not detect an underlying problem until it has prevented a critical operation from completing. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Alarms (legacy) > Global alarms.

2. Search for the Default alarm to disable.

a. In the Default Alarms section, select Filter by > Attribute Code or Attribute Name.

b. Type a search string.

Specify four characters or use wildcards (for example, A??? or AB*). Asterisks (*) represent multiple characters, and question marks (?) represent a single character. c. Click the arrow

, or press Enter.

Selecting Disabled Defaults displays a list of all currently disabled Default alarms.
