What are Prometheus metrics?

Prometheus metrics are time series measurements. The Prometheus service on Admin Nodes collects these metrics from the services on all nodes. Metrics are stored on each Admin Node until the space reserved for Prometheus data is full. When the /var/local/mysql_ibdata/ volume reaches capacity, the oldest metrics are deleted first.

Where are Prometheus metrics used?

The metrics collected by Prometheus are used in several places in the Grid Manager: Nodes page: The graphs and charts on the tabs available from the Nodes page use the Grafana visualization tool to display the time-series metrics collected by Prometheus. Grafana displays time-series data in graph and chart formats, while Prometheus serves as the backend data source.
