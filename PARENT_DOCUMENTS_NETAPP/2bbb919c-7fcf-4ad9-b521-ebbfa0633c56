Object Segmentation is enabled and the Maximum Segment Size is less than or equal to 4.5 GiB (4,831,838,208 bytes). S3 API requests that exceed this value will fail if S3 is used as the external archival storage system. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Target.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Select Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3) from the Target Type drop-down list.

Configuration settings are unavailable until you select a Target Type.

5. Configure the cloud tiering (S3) account through which the Archive Node will connect to the target external S3 capable archival storage system.

Most of the fields on this page are self-explanatory. The following describes fields for which you might need guidance.

Region: Only available if Use AWS is selected. The region you select must match the bucket’s region. ◦ Endpoint and Use AWS: For Amazon Web Services (AWS), select Use AWS. Endpoint is then automatically populated with an endpoint URL based on the Bucket Name and Region attributes. For example: https://bucket.region.amazonaws.com

For a non-AWS target, enter the URL of the system hosting the bucket, including the port number. For example: https://system.com:1080

End Point Authentication: Enabled by default. If the network to the external archival storage system is trusted, you can clear the checkbox to disable endpoint SSL certificate and hostname verification for the targeted external archival storage system. If another instance of a StorageGRID system is the target archival storage device and the system is configured with publicly signed certificates, you can keep the checkbox selected.

574

Storage Class: Select Standard (Default) for regular storage. Select Reduced Redundancy only for objects that can be easily recreated. Reduced Redundancy provides lower cost storage with less reliability. If the targeted archival storage system is another instance of the StorageGRID system, Storage Class controls how many interim copies of the object are made at ingest on the target system, if dual commit is used when objects are ingested there.

6. Select Apply Changes. The specified configuration settings are validated and applied to your StorageGRID system. After the settings are applied, the target can’t be changed.

Modify connection settings for S3 API

After the Archive Node is configured to connect to an external archival storage system through the S3 API, you can modify some settings should the connection change.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. About this task

If you change the Cloud Tiering (S3) account, you must ensure that the user access credentials have read/write access to the bucket, including all objects that were previously ingested by the Archive Node to the bucket.

Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Target.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

575

4. Modify account information, as necessary.

If you change the storage class, new object data is stored with the new storage class. Existing object continue to be stored under the storage class set when ingested.

Bucket Name, Region, and Endpoint, use AWS values and can’t be changed.

5. Select Apply Changes. Modify the Cloud Tiering Service state

You can control the Archive Node’s ability read and write to the targeted external archival storage system that connects through the S3 API by changing the state of the Cloud Tiering Service.
