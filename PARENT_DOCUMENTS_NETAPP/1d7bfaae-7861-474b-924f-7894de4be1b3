1. Review the system events for each grid node:

a. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

b. Select site > grid node > SSM > Events > Overview > Main.

2. Generate a list of previous event messages to help isolate issues that occurred in the past:

1226

a. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. b. Select site > grid node > SSM > Events > Reports.

c. Select Text.

The Last Event attribute is not shown in the charts view. To view it:

d. Change Attribute to Last Event.

e. Optionally, select a time period for Quick Query.

f. Select Update.

Create custom syslog events

Custom events allow you to track all kernel, daemon, error and critical level user events logged to the syslog server. A custom event can be useful for monitoring the occurrence of system log messages (and thus network security events and hardware faults). About this task

Consider creating custom events to monitor recurring problems. The following considerations apply to custom events.

After a custom event is created, every occurrence of it is monitored.

To create a custom event based on keywords in the /var/local/log/messages files, the logs in those files must be:

Generated by the kernel â—¦ Generated by daemon or user program at the error or critical level

Note: Not all entries in the /var/local/log/messages files will be matched unless they satisfy the requirements stated above. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Alarms (legacy) > Custom events.

2. Click Edit

(or Insert

if this is not the first event).

1227

3. Enter a custom event string, for example, shutdown

4. Select Apply Changes.

5. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

6. Select grid node > SSM > Events.

7. Locate the entry for Custom Events in the Events table, and monitor the value for Count.

If the count increases, a custom event you are monitoring is being triggered on that grid node.

1228

Reset the count of custom events to zero

If you want to reset the counter only for custom events, you must use the Grid Topology page in the Support menu.

Resetting a counter causes the alarm to be triggered by the next event. In contrast, when you acknowledge an alarm, that alarm is only re-triggered if the next threshold level is reached. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select grid node > SSM > Events > Configuration > Main.

3. Select the Reset checkbox for Custom Events.

4. Select Apply Changes. Review audit messages

Audit messages can help you get a better understanding of the detailed operations of your StorageGRID system. You can use audit logs to troubleshoot issues and to evaluate performance.

During normal system operation, all StorageGRID services generate audit messages, as follows:

System audit messages are related to the auditing system itself, grid node states, system-wide task activity, and service backup operations.

Object storage audit messages are related to the storage and management of objects within StorageGRID, including object storage and retrievals, grid-node to grid-node transfers, and verifications. If the count increases, a custom event you are monitoring is being triggered on that grid node.

Object storage audit messages are related to the storage and management of objects within StorageGRID, including object storage and retrievals, grid-node to grid-node transfers, and verifications.

Client read and write audit messages are logged when an S3 or Swift client application makes a request to create, modify, or retrieve an object.

Management audit messages log user requests to the Management API. Each Admin Node stores audit messages in text files. The audit share contains the active file (audit.log) as well as compressed audit logs from previous days. Each node in the grid also stores a copy of the audit information generated on the node.

For easy access to audit logs, you can configure audit client access for NFS. You can also access audit log files directly from the command line of the Admin Node.
