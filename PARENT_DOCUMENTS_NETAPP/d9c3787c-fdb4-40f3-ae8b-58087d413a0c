When you edit a grid federation connection, StorageGRID attempts to save a "candidate configuration" file on all Admin Nodes on the first grid. A warning message appears if this file can’t be saved to all Admin Nodes, for example, because an Admin Node is offline.

Recommended actions

1. From the grid you are using to edit the connection, select NODES.

2. Confirm that all Admin Nodes for that grid are online.

3. If any nodes are offline, bring them back online and try editing the connection again. Account clone errors

Can’t sign in to a cloned tenant account

Issue

You can’t sign in to a cloned tenant account. The error message on the Tenant Manager sign-in page is "Your credentials for this account were invalid. Please try again." Details

For security reasons, when a tenant account is cloned from the tenant’s source grid to the tenant’s destination grid, the password you set for the tenant’s local root user is not cloned. Similarly, when a tenant creates local users on its source grid, the local user passwords aren’t cloned to the destination grid.

Recommended actions

Before the root user can sign in to the tenant’s destination grid, a grid administrator must first change the password for the local root user on the destination grid.

Before a cloned local user can sign in to the tenant’s destination grid, the root user for the cloned tenant must add a password for the user on the destination grid. For instructions, see Manage local users in the instructions for using the Tenant Manager.

2. Follow the instructions to test a grid federation connection in Manage grid federation connections to confirm the issue has been fixed.

3. From the tenant’s source grid, select TENANTS.

4. Locate the tenant account that failed to be cloned.

381 Details

For each grid federation connection, the Last error column shows the most recent error to occur, if any, when a tenant’s data was being replicated to the other grid. This column only shows the last cross-grid replication error to occur; previous errors that might have occurred will not be shown. An error in this column might occur for one of these reasons:

The source object version was not found.

The source bucket was not found.

The destination bucket was deleted.

The destination bucket was re-created by a different account.

The destination bucket has versioning suspended.

The destination bucket was re-created by the same account but is now unversioned.

Recommended actions

If an error message appears in the Last error column, follow these steps:

1. Review the message text.
