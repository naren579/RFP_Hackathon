Changing the mode from COMPLIANCE to GOVERNANCE is never allowed.

Perform PutObjectRetention operations to increase, decrease, or remove an object version’s retention period.

Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide: Using S3 Object Lock Create S3 lifecycle configuration

You can create an S3 lifecycle configuration to control when specific objects are deleted from the StorageGRID system.

The simple example in this section illustrates how an S3 lifecycle configuration can control when certain objects are deleted (expired) from specific S3 buckets. The example in this section is for illustration purposes only. For complete details on creating S3 lifecycle configurations, see Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide: Object lifecycle management. Note that StorageGRID only supports Expiration actions; it does not

support Transition actions.

What lifecycle configuration is

A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that are applied to the objects in specific S3 buckets. Each rule specifies which objects are affected and when those objects will expire (on a specific date or after some number of days). StorageGRID supports up to 1,000 lifecycle rules in a lifecycle configuration. Each rule can include the following XML elements:

Expiration: Delete an object when a specified date is reached or when a specified number of days is reached, starting from when the object was ingested.

NoncurrentVersionExpiration: Delete an object when a specified number of days is reached, starting from when the object became noncurrent.

Status

ID Each object follows the retention settings of either an S3 bucket lifecycle or an ILM policy. When an S3 bucket lifecycle is configured, the lifecycle expiration actions override the ILM policy for objects matching the bucket lifecycle filter. Objects that do not match the bucket lifecycle filter use the retention settings of the ILM policy. If an object matches a bucket lifecycle filter and no expiration actions are explicitly specified, the retention settings of the ILM policy are not used and it is implied that object versions are retained forever. See Example priorities for S3 bucket lifecycle and ILM policy.

As a result, an object might be removed from the grid even though the placement instructions in an ILM rule still apply to the object. Or, an object might be retained on the grid even after any ILM placement instructions for the object have lapsed. For details, see How ILM operates throughout an object’s life. Bucket lifecycle configuration can be used with buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled, but bucket lifecycle configuration is not supported for legacy Compliant buckets.

StorageGRID supports the use of the following bucket operations to manage lifecycle configurations:

DeleteBucketLifecycle

GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration

PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration Create lifecycle configuration

As the first step in creating a lifecycle configuration, you create a JSON file that includes one or more rules. For example, this JSON file includes three rules, as follows:

1. Rule 1 applies only to objects that match the prefix category1/ and that have a key2 value of tag2. The Expiration parameter specifies that objects matching the filter will expire at midnight on 22 August 2020.

2. Rule 2 applies only to objects that match the prefix category2/. The Expiration parameter specifies that objects matching the filter will expire 100 days after they are ingested.
