Reset lost and missing object counts

After investigating the StorageGRID system and verifying that all recorded lost objects are permanently lost or that it is a false alarm, you can reset the value of the Lost Objects attribute to zero.

Before you begin

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. About this task

You can reset the Lost Objects counter from either of the following pages:

SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology > Site > Storage Node > LDR > Data Store > Overview > Main

SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology > Site > Storage Node > DDS > Data Store > Overview > Main

1271

These instructions show resetting the counter from the LDR > Data Store page. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Site > Storage Node > LDR > Data Store > Configuration for the Storage Node that has the Objects lost alert or the LOST alarm.

3. Select Reset Lost Objects Count.

4. Click Apply Changes.

The Lost Objects attribute is reset to 0 and the Objects lost alert and the LOST alarm clear, which can take a few minutes.

5. Optionally, reset other related attribute values that might have been incremented in the process of identifying the lost object.

a. Select Site > Storage Node > LDR > Erasure Coding > Configuration. b. Select Reset Reads Failure Count and Reset Corrupt Copies Detected Count.

c. Click Apply Changes.

d. Select Site > Storage Node > LDR > Verification > Configuration.

e. Select Reset Missing Objects Count and Reset Corrupt Objects Count.

f. If you are confident that quarantined objects aren’t required, you can select Delete Quarantined Objects. SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology > Site > Storage Node > LDR > Data Store > Overview > Main

a. Select Site > Storage Node > LDR > Erasure Coding > Configuration. b. Select Reset Reads Failure Count and Reset Corrupt Copies Detected Count.

c. Click Apply Changes.

d. Select Site > Storage Node > LDR > Verification > Configuration.

e. Select Reset Missing Objects Count and Reset Corrupt Objects Count.

f. If you are confident that quarantined objects aren’t required, you can select Delete Quarantined Objects.

Quarantined objects are created when background verification identifies a corrupt replicated object copy. In most cases StorageGRID automatically replaces the corrupt object, and it is safe to delete the quarantined objects. However, if the Objects lost alert or the LOST alarm is triggered, technical support might want to access the quarantined objects. g. Click Apply Changes.

It can take a few moments for the attributes to reset after you click Apply Changes.

Troubleshoot the Low object data storage alert

The Low object data storage alert monitors how much space is available for storing object data on each Storage Node.

The Low object data storage alert is triggered when the total amount of replicated and erasure-coded object data on a Storage Node meets one of the conditions configured in the alert rule.

By default, a major alert is triggered when this condition evaluates as true:

(storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes/ (storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes + storagegrid_storage_utilization_usable_space_bytes)) >=0.90 In this condition:

storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes is an estimate of the total size of replicated and erasure-coded object data for a Storage Node.

storagegrid_storage_utilization_usable_space_bytes is the total amount of object storage space remaining for a Storage Node.

If a major or minor Low object data storage alert is triggered, you should perform an expansion procedure as soon as possible. Steps

1. Select ALERTS > Current.

The Alerts page appears.

2. From the table of alerts, expand the Low object data storage alert group, if required, and select the alert you want to view.

Select the alert, not the heading for a group of alerts.

3. Review the details in the dialog box, and note the following:

Time triggered ◦ The name of the site and node ◦ The current values of the metrics for this alert

4. Select NODES > Storage Node or Site > Storage.
