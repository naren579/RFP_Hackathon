                       <b>Title:</b> The formulas provided for audit logs assume the use of default audit level settings (all categories set to
Normal, except Storage, which is set to Error). Detailed formulas for estimating the rate and average size of
audit messages for non-default audit level settings arenâ€™t available. However, the following table can be used to
make a rough estimate of the rate; you can use the average size formula provided for audit logs, but be aware
that it is likely to result in an over-estimate because the "extra" audit messages are, on average, smaller than
the default audit messages.<br>
