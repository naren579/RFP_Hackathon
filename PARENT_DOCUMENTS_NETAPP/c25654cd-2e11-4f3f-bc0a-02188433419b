Install StorageGRID on VMware

Quick start for installing StorageGRID on VMware

Follow these high-level steps to install a VMware StorageGRID node. Preparation

Learn about StorageGRID architecture and network topology.

Learn about the specifics of StorageGRID networking.

Gather and prepare the Required information and materials.

Install and configure VMware vSphere Hypervisor, vCenter, and the ESX hosts.

Prepare the required CPU and RAM.

Provide for storage and performance requirements. Deployment

201

Deploy grid nodes. When you deploy grid nodes, they are created as part of the StorageGRID system and connected to one or more networks.

Use the VMware vSphere Web Client, a .vmdk file, and a set of .ovf file templates to deploy the software- based nodes as virtual machines (VMs) on the servers you prepared in step 1.

To deploy StorageGRID appliance nodes, follow the Quick start for hardware installation. Configuration

When all nodes have been deployed, use the Grid Manager to configure the grid and complete the installation.

Automate the installation

To save time and provide consistency, you can automate the deployment and configuration of grid nodes and the configuration of the StorageGRID system.

Automate grid node deployment using VMware vSphere.

After you deploy grid nodes, automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system using the Python configuration script provided in the installation archive.

Automate the installation and configuration of appliance grid nodes

If you are an advanced developer of StorageGRID deployments, automate the installation of grid nodes by using the installation REST API.

Plan and prepare for installation on VMware

Required information and materials

Before you install StorageGRID, gather and prepare the required information and materials.

Required information Network plan

Which networks you intend to attach to each StorageGRID node. StorageGRID supports multiple networks for traffic separation, security, and administrative convenience.

See the StorageGRID Networking guidelines.

Network information

Unless you are using DHCP, IP addresses to assign to each grid node and the IP addresses of the DNS and NTP servers. Servers for grid nodes

Identify a set of servers (physical, virtual, or both) that, in aggregate, provide sufficient resources to support the number and type of StorageGRID nodes you plan to deploy. When all nodes have been deployed, use the Grid Manager to configure the grid and complete the installation.

If your StorageGRID installation will not use StorageGRID appliance (hardware) Storage Nodes, you must use hardware RAID storage with battery-backed write cache (BBWC). StorageGRID does not support the use of virtual storage area networks (vSANs), software RAID, or no RAID protection.

202

Node migration (if needed)

Understand the requirements for node migration, if you want to perform scheduled maintenance on physical hosts without any service interruption.
