What is object existence check?

Object existence check verifies whether all expected replicated copies of objects and erasure-coded fragments exist on a Storage Node. Object existence check does not verify the object data itself (background verification does that); instead, it provides a way to verify the integrity of storage devices, especially if a recent hardware issue could have affected data integrity.

Unlike background verification, which occurs automatically, you must manually start an object existence check job. 9. After corrupt objects have been automatically restored by the StorageGRID system, reset the count of corrupt objects. a. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

Object existence check does not verify the object data itself (background verification does that); instead, it provides a way to verify the integrity of storage devices, especially if a recent hardware issue could have affected data integrity.

Unlike background verification, which occurs automatically, you must manually start an object existence check job.

Object existence check reads the metadata for every object stored in StorageGRID and verifies the existence of both replicated object copies and erasure-coded object fragments. Any missing data is handled as follows: Replicated copies: If a copy of replicated object data is missing, StorageGRID automatically attempts to replace the copy from a copy stored elsewhere in the system. The Storage Node runs an existing copy through an ILM evaluation, which will determine that the current ILM policy is no longer being met for this object because another copy is missing. A new copy is generated and placed to satisfy the system’s active ILM policies. This new copy might not be placed in the same location where the missing copy was stored.

Erasure-coded fragments: If a fragment of an erasure-coded object is missing, StorageGRID automatically attempts to rebuild the missing fragment in place on the same Storage Node using the remaining fragments. If the missing fragment can’t be rebuilt (because too many fragments have been lost), ILM attempts to find another copy of the object, which it can use to generate a new erasure-coded fragment.

Run object existence check You create and run one object existence check job at a time. When you create a job, you select the Storage Nodes and volumes you want to verify. You also select the consistency for the job.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.

You have ensured that the Storage Nodes you want to check are online. Select NODES to view the table of nodes. Ensure that no alert icons appear next to the node name for the nodes you want to check.

You have ensured that the following procedures are not running on the nodes you want to check:

Grid expansion to add a Storage Node ◦ Storage Node decommission ◦ Recovery of a failed storage volume ◦ Recovery of a Storage Node with a failed system drive ◦ EC rebalance ◦ Appliance node clone

Object existence check does not provide useful information while these procedures are in progress. About this task

An object existence check job can take days or weeks to complete, depending on the number of objects in the grid, the selected storage nodes and volumes, and the selected consistency. You can run only one job at a time, but you can select multiple Storage Nodes and volumes at the same time. Steps

1. Select MAINTENANCE > Tasks > Object existence check.

2. Select Create job. The Create an object existence check job wizard appears.
