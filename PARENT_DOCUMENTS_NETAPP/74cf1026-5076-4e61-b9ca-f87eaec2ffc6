      <td>Storage State — Desired</td>
      <td>SSDS</td>
      <td>A user-configurable setting for the desired state of the\nstorage component. The LDR service reads this value\nand attempts to match the status indicated by this\nattribute. The value is persistent across restarts.\nFor example, you can use this setting to force storage\nto become read-only even when there is ample\navailable storage space. This can be useful for\ntroubleshooting.\nThe attribute can take one of the following values:\n• Offline: When the desired state is Offline, the LDR\nservice takes the LDR &gt; Storage component\noffline.\n• Read-only: When the desired state is Read-only,\nthe LDR service moves the storage state to Read-\nonly and stops accepting new content. However,\nthe LDR service continues to accept S3 or ILM\ndriven purge and delete requests. Note that\ncontent might continue to be saved to the Storage\nNode for a short time until open sessions are\nclosed.\n• Online: Leave the value at Online during normal\nsystem operations. The Storage State — Current\nof the storage component will be dynamically set\nby the service based on the condition of the LDR\nservice, such as the amount of available object\nstorage space. If space is low, the component\nbecomes Read-only.</td>
