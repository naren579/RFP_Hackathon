You must properly configure the network time protocol (NTP) on each ESX host. If the host time is incorrect, negative effects, including data loss, could occur.

VMware configuration requirements

You must install and configure VMware vSphere and vCenter before deploying StorageGRID nodes.

For supported versions of VMware vSphere Hypervisor and VMware vCenter Server software, see the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool.

For the steps required to install these VMware products, see the VMware documentation.

Other required software

To install StorageGRID on VMware, you must install some third-party software packages. Some supported Linux distributions don’t contain these packages by default. The software package versions that StorageGRID installations are tested on include those listed on this page. If you select a Linux distribution and container runtime installation option that requires any of these packages, and they are not installed automatically by the Linux distribution, install one of the versions listed here if available from your provider or the supporting vendor for your Linux distribution. Otherwise, use the default package versions available from your vendor.

All installation options require either Podman or Docker. Do not install both packages. Install only the package required by your installation option.

CPU and RAM requirements

Before installing StorageGRID software, verify and configure the hardware so that it is ready to support the StorageGRID system.

Each StorageGRID node requires the following minimum resources:

CPU cores: 8 per node

RAM: At least 24 GB per node, and 2 to 16 GB less than the total system RAM, depending on the total RAM available and the amount of non-StorageGRID software running on the system

Ensure that the number of StorageGRID nodes you plan to run on each physical or virtual host does not exceed the number of CPU cores or the physical RAM available. If the hosts aren’t dedicated to running StorageGRID (not recommended), be sure to consider the resource requirements of the other applications. Monitor your CPU and memory usage regularly to ensure that these resources continue to accommodate your workload. For example, doubling the RAM and CPU allocation for virtual Storage Nodes would provide similar resources to those provided for StorageGRID appliance nodes. Additionally, if the amount of metadata per node exceeds 500 GB, consider increasing the RAM per node to 48 GB or more. For information about managing object metadata storage, increasing the Metadata Reserved Space setting, and monitoring CPU and memory usage, see the instructions for administering, monitoring, and upgrading StorageGRID.

If hyperthreading is enabled on the underlying physical hosts, you can provide 8 virtual cores (4 physical cores)

207

per node. If hyperthreading is not enabled on the underlying physical hosts, you must provide 8 physical cores per node. If you are using virtual machines as hosts and have control over the size and number of VMs, you should use a single VM for each StorageGRID node and size the VM accordingly.

For production deployments, you should not run multiple Storage Nodes on the same physical storage hardware or virtual host. Each Storage Node in a single StorageGRID deployment should be in its own isolated failure domain. You can maximize the durability and availability of object data if you ensure that a single hardware failure can only impact a single Storage Node. See also Storage and performance requirements.

Storage and performance requirements

You must understand the storage and performance requirements for StorageGRID nodes hosted by virtual machines, so you can provide enough space to support the initial configuration and future storage expansion.
