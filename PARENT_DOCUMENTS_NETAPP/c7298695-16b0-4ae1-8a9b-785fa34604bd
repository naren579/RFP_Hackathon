Type of data to collect Why collect this data

Instructions Monitor events

Events include any system error or fault events for a node, including errors such as network errors. Monitor events to learn more about issues or to help with troubleshooting.

Monitor events

Identify trends using charts and text reports

Trends can provide valuable clues about when issues first appeared, and can help you understand how quickly things are changing.

Use charts and graphs

Use text reports Establish baselines

Collect information about the normal levels of various operational values. These baseline values, and deviations from these baselines, can provide valuable clues.

Establish baselines

Perform ingest and retrieval tests

To troubleshoot performance issues with ingest and retrieval, use a workstation to store and retrieve objects. Compare results against those seen when using the client application.

Monitor PUT and GET performance Review audit messages

Review audit messages to follow StorageGRID operations in detail. The details in audit messages can be useful for troubleshooting many types of issues, including performance issues.

Review audit messages

Check object locations and storage integrity

If you are having storage problems, verify that objects are being placed where you expect. Check the integrity of object data on a Storage Node.

Monitor object verification operations

Confirm object data locations

Verify object integrity

Collect data for technical support

Technical support might ask you to collect data or review specific information to help troubleshoot issues.

Collect log files and system data

Manually trigger an AutoSupport package

Review support metrics

Create a timeline of recent changes

When a problem occurs, you should consider what has changed recently and when those changes occurred.

Changes to your StorageGRID system, its configuration, or its environment can cause new behavior.

A timeline of changes can help you identify which changes might be responsible for an issue, and how each change might have affected its development.

Create a table of recent changes to your system that includes information about when each change occurred
