Recommended action

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with power supply A in the compute controller for a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with power supply B in the compute controller for a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

An alarm is triggered if the temperature of the CPU in the compute controller in a StorageGRID appliance exceeds a nominal threshold.

If the Storage Node is a StorageGRID appliance, the StorageGRID system indicates that the controller needs attention.

Check hardware components and environment issues for overheated condition. If necessary, replace the component.

After installation completes, a DNST alarm is triggered in the SSM service. After the DNS is configured and the new server information reaches all grid nodes, the alarm is canceled. An alarm is triggered when the background verification process detects a corrupt erasure-coded fragment. If a corrupt fragment is detected, an attempt is made to rebuild the fragment. Reset the Corrupt Fragments Detected and Copies Lost attributes to zero and monitor them to see if counts go up again. If counts do go up, there might be a problem with the Storage Node’s underlying storage. A copy of erasure-coded object data is not considered missing until such time that the number of lost or corrupt fragments breaches the erasure code’s fault tolerance; therefore, it is possible to have corrupt fragment and to still be able to retrieve the object.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

Recommended action

This alarm indicates the current status of the background verification process for erasure-coded object data on this Storage Node.

A major alarm is triggered if there is an error in the background verification process.

FOPN can become large during peak activity. If it does not diminish during periods of slow activity, contact technical support.

See recommended actions for HSTU.

HSTE and HSTU are related to HTTP for all LDR traffic, including S3, Swift, and other internal StorageGRID traffic. An alarm indicates that one of the following situations has occurred:

HTTP has been taken offline manually.

The Auto-Start HTTP attribute has been disabled.

The LDR service is shutting down. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

HTTP has been taken offline manually.

The Auto-Start HTTP attribute has been disabled.

The LDR service is shutting down.

The Auto-Start HTTP attribute is enabled by default. If this setting is changed, HTTP could remain offline after a restart.

If necessary, wait for the LDR service to restart. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select Storage Node > LDR > Configuration. If HTTP is offline, place it online. Verify that the Auto- Start HTTP attribute is enabled.

If HTTP remains offline, contact technical support.

Specifies whether to start HTTP services automatically on start-up. This is a user-specified configuration option.

An alarm indicates that inbound replication has been disabled. Confirm configuration settings: Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > LDR > Replication > Configuration > Main.

Recommended action

Check for connectivity issues.

Check system activity to confirm that there is an increase in system activity. An increase in system activity will result in an increase to attribute data activity. This increased activity will result in a delay to the processing of attribute data. This can be normal system activity and will subside.
