• You have specific access permissions. Steps

1. Select ILM > Storage pools.

The Storage pools table includes the following information for each storage pool that includes Storage Nodes:

Name: The unique display name of the storage pool. ◦ Node count: The number of nodes in the storage pool. ◦ Storage usage: The percentage of the total usable space that has been used for object data on this node. This value does not include object metadata.

Total capacity: The size of the storage pool, which equals the total amount of usable space for object data for all nodes in the storage pool.

ILM usage: How the storage pool is currently being used. A storage pool might be unused or it might be used in one or more ILM rules, erasure-coding profiles, or both.

You can’t remove a storage pool if it is being used.

2. To view details about a specific storage pool, select its name.

The details page for the storage pool appears.

3. View the Nodes tab to learn about the Storage Nodes or Archive Nodes included in the storage pool. The table includes the following information for each node: Before you begin

Node name ◦ Site name ◦ Storage grade ◦ Storage usage: The percentage of the total usable space for object data that has been used for the Storage Node. This field is not visible for Archive Node pools.

The same Storage usage (%) value is also shown in the Storage Used - Object Data chart for each Storage Node (select NODES > Storage Node > Storage).

4. Select the ILM usage tab to determine if the storage pool is currently being used in any ILM rules or erasure-coding profiles.

5. Optionally, go to the ILM rules page to learn about and manage any rules that use the storage pool.

See the instructions for working with ILM rules. Edit storage pool

You can edit a storage pool to change its name or to update sites and storage grades.

You have reviewed the guidelines for creating storage pools.

If you plan to edit a storage pool that is used by a rule in the active ILM policy, you have considered how your changes will affect object data placement. About this task

If you are adding a new site or storage grade to a storage pool that is used in the active ILM policy, be aware that the Storage Nodes in the new site or storage grade will not be used automatically. To force StorageGRID to use a new site or storage grade, you must activate a new ILM policy after saving the edited storage pool. Steps

1. Select ILM > Storage pools.

2. Select the checkbox for the storage pool you want to edit.

You can’t edit the All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier).

3. Select Edit.

4. As required, change the storage pool name.

5. As required, select other sites and storage grades.

You are prevented from changing the site or storage grade if the storage pool is used in an erasure-coding profile and the change would cause the erasure-coding scheme to become invalid. For example, if a storage pool used in a erasure-coding profile currently includes a storage grade with only one site, you are prevented from using a storage grade with two sites because the change would make the erasure-coding scheme invalid.

6. Select Save.
