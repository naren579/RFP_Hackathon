Steps

1. Select Finish to close the Simulate policy dialog. On the details page for the policy, select Retention diagram. Then select Expand all or View details for each rule as needed.

2. Review the rule’s tenant account, reference time, and filtering criteria.

As an example, suppose the metadata for the X-men rule was entered as "x-men01" instead of "x-men."

3. To resolve the error, correct the rule as follows:

If the rule is part of the policy, you can either clone the rule or remove the rule from the policy and then edit it.

If the rule is part of the active policy, you must clone the rule. You can’t edit or remove a rule from the active policy.

4. Perform the simulation again.

In this example, the corrected X-men rule now matches the Beast.jpg object based on the series=x- men user metadata, as expected.

Verify an ILM policy with object metadata lookup

After you have activated an ILM policy, you should ingest representative test objects into the StorageGRID system. You should then perform an object metadata lookup to confirm that copies are being made as intended and placed in the correct locations.

Before you begin

You have an object identifier, which can be one of: UUID: The object’s Universally Unique Identifier. Enter the UUID in all uppercase. ◦ CBID: The object’s unique identifier within StorageGRID. You can obtain an object’s CBID from the audit log. Enter the CBID in all uppercase.

S3 bucket and object key: When an object is ingested through the S3 interface, the client application uses a bucket and object key combination to store and identify the object. If the S3 bucket is versioned and you want to look up a specific version of an S3 object using the bucket and object key, you have the version ID.

Swift container and object name: When an object is ingested through the Swift interface, the client application uses a container and object name combination to store and identify the object. Steps

1. Ingest the object.

2. Select ILM > Object metadata lookup.

3. Type the object’s identifier in the Identifier field. You can enter a UUID, CBID, S3 bucket/object-key, or Swift container/object-name.
