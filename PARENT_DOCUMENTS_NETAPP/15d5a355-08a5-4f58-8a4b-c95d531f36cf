Field

Description

BKHD

Bucket UUID

The bucket ID.

BROV

Bucket read-only request value

Whether the bucket is being made read-only or is leaving the read-only state (1 = read-only, 0 = not-read-only).

BROS

Bucket read-only reason

The reason the bucket is being made read-only or leaving the read-only state. For example, emptyBucket. S3AI

S3 tenant account ID

The ID of the tenant account that sent the request. An empty value indicates anonymous access.

S3BK

S3 bucket

The S3 bucket name.

CBRB: Object Receive Begin

During normal system operations, content blocks are continuously transferred between different nodes as data is accessed, replicated and retained. When transfer of a content block from one node to another is initiated, this message is issued by the destination entity. Code

Field

Description

CNID

Connection Identifier

The unique identifier of the node-to-node session/connection.

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block being transferred.

CTDR

Transfer Direction

Indicates if the CBID transfer was push-initiated or pull-initiated:

PUSH: The transfer operation was requested by the sending entity.

PULL: The transfer operation was requested by the receiving entity.

1345

Code

Field

Description CTSR

Source Entity

The node ID of the source (sender) of the CBID transfer.

CTDS

Destination Entity

The node ID of the destination (receiver) of the CBID transfer.

CTSS

Start Sequence Count

Indicates the first sequence count requested. If successful, the transfer begins from this sequence count. CTES

Expected End Sequence Count

Indicates the last sequence count requested. If successful, the transfer is considered complete when this sequence count has been received.

RSLT

Transfer Start Status

Status at the time the transfer was started:

SUCS: Transfer started successfully.

This audit message means a node-to-node data transfer operation was initiated on a single piece of content, as identified by its Content Block Identifier. The operation requests data from "Start Sequence Count" to "Expected End Sequence Count". Sending and receiving nodes are identified by their node IDs. This information can be used to track system data flow, and when combined with storage audit messages, to verify replica counts. CBRE: Object Receive End

When transfer of a content block from one node to another is completed, this message is issued by the destination entity.

Code

Field

Description

CNID

Connection Identifier

The unique identifier of the node-to-node session/connection.

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block being transferred. CTDR

Transfer Direction

Indicates if the CBID transfer was push-initiated or pull-initiated:

PUSH: The transfer operation was requested by the sending entity.

PULL: The transfer operation was requested by the receiving entity.

CTSR

Source Entity

The node ID of the source (sender) of the CBID transfer. CTDS

Destination Entity

The node ID of the destination (receiver) of the CBID transfer.

CTSS

Start Sequence Count

Indicates the sequence count on which the transfer started.

1346

Code

Field

Description

CTAS

Actual End Sequence Count

Indicates the last sequence count successfully transferred. If the Actual End Sequence Count is the same as the Start Sequence Count, and the Transfer Result was not successful, no data was exchanged. RSLT

Transfer Result

The result of the transfer operation (from the perspective of the sending entity):

SUCS: transfer successfully completed; all requested sequence counts were sent.

CONL: connection lost during transfer

CTMO: connection timed-out during establishment or transfer

UNRE: destination node ID unreachable CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block being transferred. CTDR

Transfer Direction

Indicates if the CBID transfer was push-initiated or pull-initiated:

PUSH: The transfer operation was requested by the sending entity.

PULL: The transfer operation was requested by the receiving entity.

CTSR

Source Entity

The node ID of the source (sender) of the CBID transfer. CTDS

Destination Entity

The node ID of the destination (receiver) of the CBID transfer.

CTSS

Start Sequence Count

Indicates the sequence count on which the transfer started.

1346

Code

Field

Description

CTAS

Actual End Sequence Count

Indicates the last sequence count successfully transferred. If the Actual End Sequence Count is the same as the Start Sequence Count, and the Transfer Result was not successful, no data was exchanged. RSLT

Transfer Result

The result of the transfer operation (from the perspective of the sending entity):

SUCS: transfer successfully completed; all requested sequence counts were sent.

CONL: connection lost during transfer

CTMO: connection timed-out during establishment or transfer

UNRE: destination node ID unreachable

CRPT: transfer ended due to reception of corrupt or invalid data
