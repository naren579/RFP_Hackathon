Formula

Replication: Audit levels all set to Debug or Normal

Audit log rate = 8 x S3 Operations Rate

Erasure coding: audit levels all set to Debug or Normal

Use same formula as for default settings

Estimation formulas for security events

Security events aren’t correlated with S3 operations and typically produce a negligible volume of logs and data. For these reasons, no estimation formulas are provided. Estimation formulas for application logs

If you have no information about your S3 workload other than the number of S3 operations per second your grid is expected to support, you can estimate the volume of applications logs your external syslog server will need to handle using the following formulas:

Application Log Rate = 3.3 x S3 Operations Rate Application Log Average Size = 350 bytes

So, for example, if your grid is sized for 1,000 S3 operations per second, your external syslog server should be sized to support 3,300 application logs per second and be able to receive (and store) application log data at a rate of about 1.2 MB per second. If you know more about your workload, more accurate estimations are possible. For application logs, the most important additional variables are the data protection strategy (replication vs. erasure coding), the percentage of S3 operations that are PUTs (vs. GETs/other), and the average size, in bytes, of the following S3 fields (4- character abbreviations used in table are audit log field names): Code

Field

Description

SACC

S3 tenant account name (request sender)

The name of the tenant account for the user who sent the request. Empty for anonymous requests.

SBAC

S3 tenant account name (bucket owner)

The tenant account name for the bucket owner. Used to identify cross-account or anonymous access. S3BK

S3 bucket

The S3 bucket name.

S3KY

S3 key

The S3 key name, not including the bucket name. Operations on buckets don’t include this field. Example sizing estimations

This section explains example cases of how to use the estimation formulas for grids with the following methods of data protection:

Replication

Erasure coding

If you use replication for data protection

Let P represent the percentage of S3 operations that are PUTs, where 0 ≤ P ≤ 1 (so for a 100% PUT workload, P = 1, and for a 100% GET workload, P = 0).

Let K represent the average size of the sum of the S3 account names, S3 bucket, and S3 key. Suppose the S3 account name is always my-s3-account (13 bytes), buckets have fixed-length names like /my/application/bucket-12345 (28 bytes), and objects have fixed-length keys like 5733a5d7-f069-41ef-8fbd- 13247494c69c (36 bytes). Then K has a value of 90 (13+13+28+36).

If you can determine values for P and K, you can estimate the volume of application logs your external syslog server will have to be able to handle using the following formulas. Application Log Rate = ((1.1 x P) + (2.5 x (1 - P))) x S3 Operations Rate Application Log Average Size = (P x (220 + K)) + ((1 - P) x (240 + (0.2 x K))) Bytes

Let P represent the percentage of S3 operations that are PUTs, where 0 ≤ P ≤ 1 (so for a 100% PUT workload, P = 1, and for a 100% GET workload, P = 0).

So, for example, if your grid is sized for 1,000 S3 operations per second, your workload is 50% PUTs, and your S3 account names, bucket names, and object names average 90 bytes, your external syslog server should be sized to support 1800 application logs per second, and will be receiving (and typically storing) application data at a rate of 0.5 MB per second.

If you use erasure coding for data protection

Let P represent the percentage of S3 operations that are PUTs, where 0 ≤ P ≤ 1 (so for a 100% PUT workload, P = 1, and for a 100% GET workload, P = 0).
