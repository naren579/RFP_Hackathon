Description

activeAlertCount 3. To extract the StorageGRID OIDs from the MIB file:

a. Get the OID of the root of the StorageGRID MIB:

root@user-adm1:~ # snmptranslate -On -IR storagegrid

Result: .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.28669 (28669 is always the OID for StorageGRID)

b. Grep for the StorageGRID OID in the entire tree (using paste to join lines):

root@user-adm1:~ # snmptranslate -Tso | paste -d " " - - | grep 28669 The snmptranslate command has many options that are useful for exploring the MIB. This command is available on any StorageGRID node.

Collect additional StorageGRID data Use charts and graphs

You can use charts and reports to monitor the state of the StorageGRID system and troubleshoot problems.

The Grid Manager is updated with each release and might not match the example screenshots on this page. Types of charts

Charts and graphs summarize the values of specific StorageGRID metrics and attributes.

1207

The Grid Manager dashboard includes cards that summarize available storage for the grid and each site.

The Storage usage panel on the Tenant Manager dashboard displays the following:

A list of the largest buckets (S3) or containers (Swift) for the tenant

A bar chart that represents the relative sizes of the largest buckets or containers

The total amount of space used and, if a quota is set, the amount and percentage of space remaining

In addition, graphs that show how StorageGRID metrics and attributes change over time are available from the Nodes page and from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page.

There are four types of graphs:

Grafana charts: Shown on the Nodes page, Grafana charts are used to plot the values of Prometheus metrics over time. For example, the NODES > Network tab for a Storage Node includes a Grafana chart for network traffic. 1209

Grafana charts are also included on the pre-constructed dashboards available from the SUPPORT > Tools > Metrics page.

Line graphs: Available from the Nodes page and from the SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology page after a data value), line graphs are used to plot the values of StorageGRID
