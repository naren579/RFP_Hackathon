Perform the upgrade

You can upgrade to StorageGRID 11.8 and apply the latest hotfix for that release at the same time. The StorageGRID upgrade page provides the recommended upgrade path and links directly to the correct download pages.

Before you begin

You have reviewed all of the considerations and completed all of the planning and preparation steps. Access StorageGRID Upgrade page

As a first step, access the StorageGRID Upgrade page in the Grid Manager.

Steps

1. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

2. Select MAINTENANCE > System > Software update.

3. From the StorageGRID upgrade tile, select Upgrade.

Select files

The update path on the StorageGRID Upgrade page indicates which major versions (for example, 11.8.0) and hotfixes (for example, 11.8.0.1) you must install to get to the latest StorageGRID release. You should install the recommended versions and hotfixes in the order shown.

If no update path is shown, your browser might not be able to access the NetApp Support Site, or the Check for software updates checkbox on the AutoSupport page (SUPPORT > Tools > AutoSupport) might be disabled. Steps

1. For the Select files step, review the update path.

2. From the Download files section, select each Download link to download the required files from the NetApp Support Site.

If no update path is shown, go to the NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID to determine if a new version or hotfix is available and to download the files you need.

If you needed to download and install an RPM or DEB package on all Linux hosts, you might already have the StorageGRID upgrade and hotfix files listed in the update path.

3. Select Browse to upload the version upgrade file to StorageGRID: NetApp_StorageGRID_11.8.0_Software_uniqueID.upgrade

When the upload and validation process is done, a green check mark appears next to the file name.

4. If you downloaded a hotfix file, select Browse to upload that file. The hotfix will be automatically applied as part of the version upgrade.
