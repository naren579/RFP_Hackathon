3. Object transitioned to Archive tier (non-retrievable state) Immediately after moving the object to the Azure Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID automatically transitions the object to the Azure Blob storage Archive tier.

4. Object restored from Archive tier

If an object has been transitioned to the Archive tier, the client application can issue an S3 RestoreObject request to restore a retrievable copy to the Azure Cloud Storage Pool.

When StorageGRID receives the RestoreObject, it temporarily transitions the object to the Azure Blob storage Cool tier. As soon as the expiration date in the RestoreObject request is reached, StorageGRID transitions the object back to the Archive tier.

If one or more copies of the object also exist on Storage Nodes within StorageGRID, there is no need to restore the object from the Archive access tier by issuing a RestoreObject request. Instead, the local copy can be retrieved directly, using a GetObject request.

5. Object retrieved Once an object has been restored to the Azure Cloud Storage Pool, the client application can issue a GetObject request to retrieve the restored object.

When to use Cloud Storage Pools

Using Cloud Storage Pools, you can back up or tier data to an external location. Additionally, you can back up or tier data to more than one cloud. Back up StorageGRID data to external location

When to use Cloud Storage Pools

Using Cloud Storage Pools, you can back up or tier data to an external location. Additionally, you can back up or tier data to more than one cloud. Back up StorageGRID data to external location

You can use a Cloud Storage Pool to back up StorageGRID objects to an external location.

If the copies in StorageGRID are inaccessible, the object data in the Cloud Storage Pool can be used to serve client requests. However, you might need to issue S3 RestoreObject request to access the backup object copy in the Cloud Storage Pool.

The object data in a Cloud Storage Pool can also be used to recover data lost from StorageGRID because of a storage volume or Storage Node failure. If the only remaining copy of an object is in a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID temporarily restores the object and creates a new copy on the recovered Storage Node.

To implement a backup solution:

1. Create a single Cloud Storage Pool.

2. Configure an ILM rule that simultaneously stores object copies on Storage Nodes (as replicated or erasure- coded copies) and a single object copy in the Cloud Storage Pool. 3. Add the rule to your ILM policy. Then, simulate and activate the policy.

Tier data from StorageGRID to external location

You can use a Cloud Storage Pool to store objects outside of the StorageGRID system. For example, suppose you have a large number of objects that you need to retain, but you expect to access those objects rarely, if ever. You can use a Cloud Storage Pool to tier the objects to lower-cost storage and to free up space in StorageGRID.

To implement a tiering solution:

1. Create a single Cloud Storage Pool.

2. Configure an ILM rule that moves rarely used objects from Storage Nodes to the Cloud Storage Pool.

3. Add the rule to your ILM policy. Then, simulate and activate the policy. Maintain multiple cloud endpoints

You can configure multiple Cloud Storage Pool endpoints if you want to tier or back up object data to more than one cloud. The filters in your ILM rules let you specify which objects are stored in each Cloud Storage Pool. For example, you might want to store objects from some tenants or buckets in Amazon S3 Glacier and objects from other tenants or buckets in Azure Blob storage. Or, you might want to move data between Amazon S3 Glacier and Azure Blob storage.

When using multiple Cloud Storage Pool endpoints, keep in mind that an object can be stored in only one Cloud Storage Pool at a time.
