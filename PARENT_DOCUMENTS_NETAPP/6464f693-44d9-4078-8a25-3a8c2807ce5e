      <td>One StorageGRID system acts as a disaster\nrecovery system. Objects in a bucket can be\nreplicated between the grids in one or both\ndirections.</td>
      <td>Enables a tenant to automatically replicate\nobjects from a bucket in StorageGRID\n(source) to an external S3 bucket\n(destination).\nCloudMirror replication creates an\nindependent copy of an object in an\nindependent S3 infrastructure. This\nindependent copy is not used as a backup,\nbut often further processed in the cloud.</td>

      <th>2</th>
      <td>How is it set\nup?</td>
      <td>1. Configure a grid federation connection\nbetween two grids.\n2. Add new tenant accounts, which are\nautomatically cloned to the other grid.\n3. Add new tenant groups and users, which\nare also cloned.\n4. Create corresponding buckets on each\ngrid and enable cross-grid replication to\noccur in one or both directions.</td>
      <td>1. A tenant user configures CloudMirror\nreplication by defining a CloudMirror\nendpoint (IP address, credentials, and so\non) using the Tenant Manager or the S3\nAPI.\n2. Any bucket owned by that tenant account\ncan be configured to point to the\nCloudMirror endpoint.</td>
