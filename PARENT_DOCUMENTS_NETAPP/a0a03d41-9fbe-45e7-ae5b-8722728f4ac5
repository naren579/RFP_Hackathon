Generally, you try to preserve data from the failed grid node where possible, repair or replace the failed node, use the Grid Manager to configure the replacement node, and restore the node’s data. If an entire StorageGRID site has failed, contact technical support. Technical support will work with you to develop and execute a site recovery plan that maximizes the amount of data that is recovered, and meets your business objectives. See How technical support recovers a site. Warnings and considerations for grid node recovery

If a grid node fails, you must recover it as soon as possible. You must review all warnings and considerations for node recovery before you begin.

StorageGRID is a distributed system composed of multiple nodes working with each other. Don’t use disk snapshots to restore grid nodes. Instead, refer to the recovery and maintenance procedures for each type of node.

Some of the reasons for recovering a failed grid node as soon as possible include the following:

A failed grid node can reduce the redundancy of system and object data, leaving you vulnerable to the risk of permanent data loss if another node fails.

A failed grid node can impact the efficiency of day‐to‐day operations.

A failed grid node can reduce your ability to monitor system operations.

A failed grid node can cause a 500 internal server error if strict ILM rules are in place. If a grid node is not recovered promptly, recovery times might increase. For example, queues might develop that need to be cleared before recovery is complete.

Always follow the recovery procedure for the specific type of grid node you are recovering. Recovery procedures vary for primary or non-primary Admin Nodes, Gateway Nodes, Archive Nodes, appliance nodes, and Storage Nodes.

Preconditions for recovering grid nodes

All of the following conditions are assumed when recovering grid nodes:

The failed physical or virtual hardware has been replaced and configured.

• The StorageGRID Appliance Installer version on the replacement appliance matches the software version

of your StorageGRID system, as described in Verify and upgrade StorageGRID Appliance Installer version.

If you are recovering a grid node other than the primary Admin Node, there is connectivity between the grid node being recovered and the primary Admin Node. Order of node recovery if a server hosting more than one grid node fails

If a server that is hosting more than one grid node fails, you can recover the nodes in any order. However, if the failed server is hosting the primary Admin Node, you must recover that node first. Recovering the primary Admin Node first prevents other node recoveries from halting as they wait to contact the primary Admin Node.

IP addresses for recovered nodes

Don’t attempt to recover a node using an IP address that is currently assigned to any other node. When you deploy the new node, use the failed node’s current IP address or an unused IP address.

If you use a new IP address to deploy the new node and then recover the node, the new IP address will continue to be used for the recovered node. If you want to revert to the original IP address, use the Change IP tool after the recovery is complete.

Gather required materials for grid node recovery Before performing maintenance procedures, you must ensure you have the necessary materials to recover a failed grid node.

Notes

StorageGRID installation archive

If you need to recover a grid node, you need to download the StorageGRID installation files for your platform.

Note: You don’t need to download files if you are recovering failed storage volumes on a Storage Node. Service laptop

The service laptop must have the following:

Network port

SSH client (for example, PuTTY)

Supported web browser

Notes Recovery Package .zip file

Obtain a copy of the most recent Recovery Package .zip file: sgws-recovery-package-id-revision.zip

The contents of the .zip file are updated each time the system is modified. You are directed to store the most recent version of the Recovery Package in a secure location after making such changes. Use the most recent copy to recover from grid failures. If you use a new IP address to deploy the new node and then recover the node, the new IP address will continue to be used for the recovered node. If you want to revert to the original IP address, use the Change IP tool after the recovery is complete.
