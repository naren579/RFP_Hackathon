History of recent changes: The details of your recovery procedure can be affected by whether any maintenance procedures were in progress at the time of the failure or whether any recent changes were made to your ILM policies. Technical support must assess the recent history of your grid as well as its current situation before beginning a site recovery.

Site recovery can only be performed by technical support.

This is a general overview of the process that technical support uses to recover a failed site: 1. Technical support:

a. Makes a detailed assessment of the failure.

b. Works with you to review your business objectives.

c. Develops a recovery plan tailored for your situation.

2. If the primary Admin Node if it has failed, technical support recovers it.

3. Technical support recovers all Storage Nodes, following this outline:

a. Replace Storage Node hardware or virtual machines as required. b. Restore object metadata to the failed site.

c. Restore object data to the recovered Storage Nodes.

Data loss will occur if the recovery procedures for a single failed Storage Node are used.

When an entire site has failed, technical support uses specialized commands to successfully restore objects and object metadata.

4. Technical support recovers other failed nodes.

After object metadata and data have been recovered, technical support uses standard procedures to recover failed Gateway Nodes, non-primary Admin Nodes, or Archive Nodes.
