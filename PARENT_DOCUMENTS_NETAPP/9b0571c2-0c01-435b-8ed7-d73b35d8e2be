What is S3 Object Lock?

The StorageGRID S3 Object Lock feature is an object-protection solution that is equivalent to S3 Object Lock in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

As shown in the figure, when the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled for a StorageGRID system, an S3 tenant account can create buckets with or without S3 Object Lock enabled. If a bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled, bucket versioning is required and is enabled automatically.
