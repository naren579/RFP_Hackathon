If omitted, a MAC address will be generated automatically.

GRID_NETWORK_MASK

Value

IPv4 netmask for this node on the Grid Network. Specify this key when GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC; don’t specify it for other values. Examples:

255.255.255.0

255.255.248.0

GRID_NETWORK_MTU

Value

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for this node on the Grid Network. Don’t specify if GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = DHCP. If specified, the value must be between 1280 and 9216. If omitted, 1500 is used.

If you want to use jumbo frames, set the MTU to a value suitable for jumbo frames, such as 9000. Otherwise, keep the default value.

IMPORTANT: The MTU value of the network must match the value configured on the switch port the node is connected to. Otherwise, network performance issues or packet loss might occur.

IMPORTANT: For the best network performance, all nodes should be configured with similar MTU values on their Grid Network interfaces. The Grid Network MTU mismatch alert is triggered if there is a significant difference in MTU settings for the Grid Network on individual nodes. The MTU values don’t have to be the same for all network types. Examples:

1500

8192

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET

Value

Designation

Required when GRID_NETWORK_IP is specified and GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.

Designation

Optional

Designation

111

Name of the host device that you will use for Grid Network access by the StorageGRID node. Only network interface names are supported. Typically, you use a different interface name than what was specified for ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET or CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET.

Note: Don’t use bond or bridge devices as the network target. Either configure a VLAN (or other virtual interface) on top of the bond device, or use a bridge and virtual Ethernet (veth) pair. Examples:

bond0.1001

ens192

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE

Value

Interface (This is the only supported value.)

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC

Value

True or False

Set the value of the key to "true" to cause the StorageGRID container to use the MAC address of the host target interface on the Grid Network. 1500

8192

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET

Value

Designation

Required when GRID_NETWORK_IP is specified and GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE

Value

Interface (This is the only supported value.)

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC

Value

True or False

Set the value of the key to "true" to cause the StorageGRID container to use the MAC address of the host target interface on the Grid Network.

Best practice: In networks where promiscuous mode would be required, use the GRID_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC key instead. For more details on MAC cloning:

INTERFACE_TARGET_nnnn

Required

Designation

Optional

Designation

Best practice Designation

Name and optional description for an extra interface you want to add to this node. You can add multiple extra interfaces to each node.

For nnnn, specify a unique number for each INTERFACE_TARGET entry you are adding.

For the value, specify the name of the physical interface on the bare- metal host. Then, optionally, add a comma and provide a description of the interface, which is displayed on the VLAN interfaces page and the HA groups page. Example: INTERFACE_TARGET_0001=ens256, Trunk

If you add a trunk interface, you must configure a VLAN interface in StorageGRID. If you add an access interface, you can add the interface directly to an HA group; you don’t need to configure a VLAN interface.

Maximum RAM key

MAXIMUM_RAM

Value

The maximum amount of RAM that this node is allowed to consume. If this key is omitted, the node has no memory restrictions. When setting this field for a production-level node, specify a value that is at least 24 GB and 16 to 32 GB less than the total system RAM.

Note: The RAM value affects a node’s actual metadata reserved space. See the description of what Metadata Reserved Space is.

The format for this field is numberunit, where unit can be b, k, m, or g. Examples:

24g

38654705664b

Note: If you want to use this option, you must enable kernel support for memory cgroups.
