565 Some maintenance tasks can only be performed using the primary Admin Node. If the primary Admin Node fails, it must be recovered before the StorageGRID system is fully functional again. Identify the primary Admin Node

The primary Admin Node hosts the CMN service. Some maintenance procedures can only be performed using the primary Admin Node.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select site > Admin Node, and then select on this Admin Node.

2. Select site > Admin Node, and then select on this Admin Node.

The primary Admin Node hosts the CMN service.

3. If this Admin Node does not host the CMN service, check the other Admin Nodes. View notification status and queues

The Network Management System (NMS) service on Admin Nodes sends notifications to the mail server. You can view the current status of the NMS service and the size of its notifications queue on the Interface Engine page.

To access the Interface Engine page, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Finally, select site > Admin Node > NMS > Interface Engine.

Notifications are processed through the email notifications queue and are sent to the mail server one after another in the order they are triggered. If there is a problem (for example, a network connection error) and the mail server is unavailable when the attempt is made to send the notification, a best effort attempt to resend the notification to the mail server continues for a period of 60 seconds. If the notification is not sent to the mail server after 60 seconds, the notification is dropped from the notifications queue and an attempt to send the next notification in the queue is made. Because notifications can be dropped from the notifications queue without being sent, it is possible that an alarm can be triggered without a notification being sent. If a notification is dropped from the queue without being sent, the MINS (E-mail Notification Status) minor alarm is triggered.

How Admin Nodes show acknowledged alarms (legacy system)

When you acknowledge an alarm on one Admin Node, the acknowledged alarm is not copied to any other Admin Node. Because acknowledgments aren’t copied to other Admin Nodes, the Grid Topology tree might not look the same for each Admin Node.

This difference can be useful when connecting web clients. Web clients can have different views of the StorageGRID system based on the administrator needs.

Note that notifications are sent from the Admin Node where the acknowledgment occurs. Configure audit client access

Configure audit client access for NFS

The Admin Node, through the Audit Management System (AMS) service, logs all audited system events to a log file available through the audit share, which is added to each Admin Node at installation. The audit share is automatically enabled as a read-only share.

Support for NFS has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

To access audit logs, you can configure client access to audit shares for NFS. Or, you can use an external syslog server.

The StorageGRID system uses positive acknowledgment to prevent loss of audit messages before they are written to the log file. A message remains queued at a service until the AMS service or an intermediate audit relay service has acknowledged control of it. For more information, see Review audit logs.

Before you begin

You have the Passwords.txt file with the root/admin password.

You have the Configuration.txt file (available in the Recovery Package). The audit client is using NFS Version 3 (NFSv3).

About this task

Perform this procedure for each Admin Node in a StorageGRID deployment from which you want to retrieve audit messages.

Steps

1. Log in to the primary Admin Node: a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@primary_Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Confirm that all services have a state of Running or Verified. Enter: storagegrid-status

If any services aren’t listed as Running or Verified, resolve issues before continuing.

3. Return to the command line. Press Ctrl+C.

4. Start the NFS configuration utility. Enter: config_nfs.rb
