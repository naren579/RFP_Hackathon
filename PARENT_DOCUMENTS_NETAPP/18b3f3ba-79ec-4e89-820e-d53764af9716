Configure email notifications for alarms (legacy system)

To receive email notifications for the legacy alarm system, recipients must be a member of a mailing list and that list must be added to the Notifications page. Notifications are configured to send email to recipients only when an alarm with a specified severity level is triggered or when a service state changes. Thus, recipients only receive the notifications they need to receive.

Use these settings to configure notifications for legacy alarms. These settings aren’t used for alert notifications.

If an email address (or list) belongs to multiple mailing lists, only one email notification is sent when a notification triggering event occurs. For example, one group of administrators within your organization can be configured to receive notifications for all alarms regardless of severity.
