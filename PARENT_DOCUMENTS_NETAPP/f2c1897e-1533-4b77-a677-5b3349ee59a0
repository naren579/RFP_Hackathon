Step 3 of 3: Select ingest behavior

The Select ingest behavior step of the Create ILM Rule wizard allows you to choose how the objects filtered by this rule are protected as they are ingested. About this task

StorageGRID can make interim copies and queue the objects for ILM evaluation later, or it can make copies to meet the rule’s placement instructions immediately. Steps

1. Select the ingest behavior to use.

For more information, see Advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the ingest options.

You can’t use the Balanced or Strict option if the rule uses one of these placements:

A Cloud Storage Pool at day 0 ◦ An Archive Node at day 0 ◦ A Cloud Storage Pool or an Archive Node when the rule uses a User defined creation time as a Reference time

See Example 5: ILM rules and policy for Strict ingest behavior.

2. Select Create.

The ILM rule is created. The rule does not become active until it is added to an ILM policy and that policy is activated.

To view the details of the rule, select the rule’s name on the ILM rules page.

Create a default ILM rule

Before creating an ILM policy, you must create a default rule to place any objects not matched by another rule in the policy. The default rule can’t use any filters. It must apply to all tenants, all buckets, and all object versions.

Before you begin You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions. About this task

The default rule is the last rule to be evaluated in an ILM policy, so it can’t use any filters. The placement instructions for the default rule are applied to any objects that aren’t matched by another rule in the policy.

In this example policy, the first rule applies only to objects belonging to test-tenant-1. The default rule, which is last, applies to objects belonging to all other tenant accounts.

When you create the default rule, keep these requirements in mind:

The default rule will automatically be placed as the last rule when you add it to a policy.

The default rule can’t use any basic or advanced filters.

664

• The default rule must apply to all object versions.

The default rule should create replicated copies.

Don’t use a rule that creates erasure-coded copies as the default rule for a policy. Erasure- coding rules should use an advanced filter to prevent smaller objects from being erasure- coded. In general, the default rule should retain objects forever.

If you are using (or you plan to enable) the global S3 Object Lock setting, the default rule must be compliant.
