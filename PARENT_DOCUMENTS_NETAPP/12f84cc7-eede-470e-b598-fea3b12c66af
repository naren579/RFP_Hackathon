Alarms (legacy system) are triggered when system attributes reach alarm threshold values. You can view the currently active alarms from the Current Alarms page.

While the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the alert system offers significant benefits and is easier to use.

Before you begin

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Alarms (legacy) > Current alarms.

The alarm icon indicates the severity of each alarm, as follows:

Icon

Color

Alarm severity Meaning

Yellow

Notice

The node is connected to the grid, but an unusual condition exists that does not affect normal operations.

Light Orange Minor

The node is connected to the grid, but an abnormal condition exists that could affect operation in the future. You should investigate to prevent escalation.

Alarm severity Meaning

Dark Orange

Major

The node is connected to the grid, but an abnormal condition exists that currently affects operation. This requires prompt attention to prevent escalation. Red

Critical

The node is connected to the grid, but an abnormal condition exists that has stopped normal operations. You should address the issue immediately.

2. To learn about the attribute that caused the alarm to be triggered, right click the attribute name in the table.

3. To view additional details about an alarm, click the service name in the table.

The Alarms tab for the selected service appears (SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology > Grid Node > Service > Alarms).

4. If you want to clear the count of current alarms, you can optionally do the following:

Acknowledge the alarm. An acknowledged alarm is no longer included in the count of legacy alarms unless it is triggered at the next severity level or it is resolved and occurs again.

Disable a particular Default alarm or Global Custom alarm for the entire system to prevent it from being triggered again.

The following table lists all of the legacy Default alarms. If an alarm is triggered, you can look up the alarm code in this table to find the recommended actions.

While the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the alert system offers significant benefits and is easier to use.

Recommended action

Restore connectivity to a service (an ADC service) running an Attribute Relay Service as soon as possible. If there are no connected attribute relays, the grid node can’t report attribute values to the NMS service. Thus, the NMS service can no longer monitor the status of the service, or update attributes for the service.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered when an LDR or ARC service loses connection to a DDS service. If this occurs, ingest or retrieve transactions can’t be processed. If the unavailability of DDS services is only a brief transient issue, transactions can be delayed.

Check and restore connections to a DDS service to clear this alarm and return the service to full functionality. 1140
