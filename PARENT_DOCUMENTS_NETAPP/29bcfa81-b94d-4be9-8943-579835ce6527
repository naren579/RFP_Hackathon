storagegrid_content_buckets_and_containers

The total number of S3 buckets and Swift containers known by this Storage Node.

storagegrid_content_objects

The total number of S3 and Swift data objects known by this Storage Node. Count is valid only for data objects created by client applications that interface with the system through S3 or Swift. storagegrid_content_objects_lost

The total number of objects this service detects as missing from the StorageGRID system. Action should be taken to determine the cause of the loss and if recovery is possible.

storagegrid_http_sessions_incoming_attempted

The total number of HTTP sessions that have been attempted to a Storage Node. storagegrid_http_sessions_incoming_currently_established

The number of HTTP sessions that are currently active (open) on the Storage Node.

storagegrid_http_sessions_incoming_failed

The total number of HTTP sessions that failed to complete successfully, either due to a malformed HTTP request or a failure while processing an operation. storagegrid_http_sessions_incoming_successful

The total number of HTTP sessions that have completed successfully.

storagegrid_ilm_awaiting_background_objects

The total number of objects on this node awaiting ILM evaluation from the scan.

storagegrid_ilm_awaiting_client_evaluation_objects_per_second

The current rate at which objects are evaluated against the ILM policy on this node.

1116

storagegrid_ilm_awaiting_client_objects

The total number of objects on this node awaiting ILM evaluation from client operations (for example, ingest). storagegrid_ilm_awaiting_total_objects

The total number of objects awaiting ILM evaluation.

storagegrid_ilm_scan_objects_per_second

The rate at which objects owned by this node are scanned and queued for ILM.

storagegrid_ilm_scan_period_estimated_minutes

The estimated time to complete a full ILM scan on this node.

Note: A full scan does not guarantee that ILM has been applied to all objects owned by this node. storagegrid_load_balancer_endpoint_cert_expiry_time

The expiration time of the load balancer endpoint certificate in seconds since the epoch.

storagegrid_metadata_queries_average_latency_milliseconds

The average time required to run a query against the metadata store through this service.

storagegrid_network_received_bytes

The total amount of data received since installation. storagegrid_network_transmitted_bytes

The total amount of data sent since installation.

storagegrid_node_cpu_utilization_percentage

The percentage of available CPU time currently being used by this service. Indicates how busy the service is. The amount of available CPU time depends on the number of CPUs for the server. storagegrid_ntp_chosen_time_source_offset_milliseconds

Systematic offset of time provided by a chosen time source. Offset is introduced when the delay to reach a time source is not equal to the time required for the time source to reach the NTP client.

storagegrid_ntp_locked

The node is not locked to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. storagegrid_s3_data_transfers_bytes_ingested

The total amount of data ingested from S3 clients to this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset.

storagegrid_s3_data_transfers_bytes_retrieved

The total amount of data retrieved by S3 clients from this Storage Node since the attribute was last reset. storagegrid_s3_operations_failed

The total number of failed S3 operations (HTTP status codes 4xx and 5xx), excluding those caused by S3 authorization failure.

storagegrid_s3_operations_successful

The total number of successful S3 operations (HTTP status code 2xx).
