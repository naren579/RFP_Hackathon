ILM evaluation rate

Objects/second

From the Nodes page, select grid > ILM.

On the ILM Queue chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate a baseline value for Evaluation rate for your system.

How to obtain ILM scan rate

Objects/second

Select NODES > grid > ILM.

On the ILM Queue chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate a baseline value for Scan rate for your system.

Objects queued from client operations

Objects/second

Select NODES > grid > ILM.

On the ILM Queue chart, find a period where the line is fairly stable. Position your cursor over the chart to estimate a baseline value for Objects queued (from client operations) for your system. Average query latency

Milliseconds

Select NODES > Storage Node > Objects. In the Queries table, view the value for Average Latency.

Analyze data

Use the information that you collect to determine the cause of the problem and potential solutions.

The analysis is problem‐dependent, but in general:

Locate points of failure and bottlenecks using the alarms.

Reconstruct the problem history using the alarm history and charts.

Use charts to find anomalies and compare the problem situation with normal operation. Escalation information checklist

If you can’t resolve the problem on your own, contact technical support. Before contacting technical support, gather the information listed in the following table to facilitate problem resolution.

Notes

Problem statement

What are the problem symptoms? When did the problem start? Does it happen consistently or intermittently? If intermittently, what times has it occurred? Define the problem

Impact assessment

What is the severity of the problem? What is the impact to the client application?

Has the client connected successfully before?

Can the client ingest, retrieve, and delete data?

StorageGRID System ID

Select MAINTENANCE > System > License. The StorageGRID System ID is shown as part of the current license. Software version

From the top of the Grid Manager, select the help icon and select About to see the StorageGRID version.

Customization

Summarize how your StorageGRID system is configured. For example, list the following:

Does the grid use storage compression, storage encryption, or compliance?

Does ILM make replicated or erasure-coded objects? Does ILM ensure site redundancy? Do ILM rules use the Balanced, Strict, or Dual Commit ingest behaviors? Log files and system data

Collect log files and system data for your system. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Logs.

You can collect logs for the entire grid, or for selected nodes.

If you are collecting logs only for selected nodes, be sure to include at least one Storage Node that has the ADC service. (The first three Storage Nodes at a site include the ADC service.) Collect log files and system data

Baseline information

Collect baseline information regarding ingest operations, retrieval operations, and storage consumption.

Establish baselines

Timeline of recent changes

Create a timeline that summarizes any recent changes to the system or its environment.

History of efforts to diagnose the issue

If you have taken steps to diagnose or troubleshoot the issue yourself, make sure to record the steps you took and the outcome. Troubleshoot object and storage issues

Confirm object data locations

Depending on the problem, you might want to confirm where object data is being stored. For example, you might want to verify that the ILM policy is performing as expected and

object data is being stored where intended.

Before you begin

You must have an object identifier, which can be one of:

UUID: The object’s Universally Unique Identifier. Enter the UUID in all uppercase. ◦ CBID: The object’s unique identifier within StorageGRID . You can obtain an object’s CBID from the audit log. Enter the CBID in all uppercase. If you are collecting logs only for selected nodes, be sure to include at least one Storage Node that has the ADC service.
