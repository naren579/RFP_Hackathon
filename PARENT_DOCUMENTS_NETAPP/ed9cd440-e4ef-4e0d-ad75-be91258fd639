Manage platform services for tenants: Overview

If you enable platform services for S3 tenant accounts, you must configure your grid so that tenants can access the external resources necessary to use these services.

What are platform services?

Platform services include CloudMirror replication, event notifications, and the search integration service. CloudMirror replication

The StorageGRID CloudMirror replication service is used to mirror specific objects from a StorageGRID bucket to a specified external destination.

For example, you might use CloudMirror replication to mirror specific customer records into Amazon S3 and then leverage AWS services to perform analytics on your data.

CloudMirror replication has some important similarities and differences with the cross-grid replication feature. To learn more, see Compare cross-grid replication and CloudMirror replication.

CloudMirror replication is not supported if the source bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled. Notifications

Per-bucket event notifications are used to send notifications about specific actions performed on objects to a specified external Kafka cluster or Amazon Simple Notification Service.

For example, you could configure alerts to be sent to administrators about each object added to a bucket, where the objects represent log files associated with a critical system event.

Although event notification can be configured on a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, the S3 Object Lock metadata (including Retain Until Date and Legal Hold status) of the objects will not be included in the notification messages. Search integration service If you enable platform services for S3 tenant accounts, you must configure your grid so that tenants can access the external resources necessary to use these services.
