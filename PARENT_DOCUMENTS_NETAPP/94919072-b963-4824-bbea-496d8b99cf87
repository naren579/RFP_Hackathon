      <td>This alarm is triggered when the Metadata Effective\nSpace (CEMS) reaches 70% full (minor alarm), 90%\nfull (major alarm), and 100% full (critical alarm).\nIf this alarm reaches the 90% threshold, a warning\nappears on the dashboard in the Grid Manager. You\nmust perform an expansion procedure to add new\nExpand a Storage Nodes as soon as possible. See\ngrid.\nIf this alarm reaches the 100% threshold, you must\nstop ingesting objects and add Storage Nodes\nimmediately. Cassandra requires a certain amount of\nspace to perform essential operations such as\ncompaction and repair. These operations will be\nimpacted if object metadata uses more than 100% of\nthe allowed space. Undesirable results can occur.\nNote: Contact technical support if you are unable to\nadd Storage Nodes.\nAfter new Storage Nodes are added, the system\nautomatically rebalances object metadata across all\nStorage Nodes, and the alarm clears.\nAlso see information about troubleshooting the Low\nmetadata storage alert in Troubleshoot metadata\nissues.\nIf the problem persists, contact technical support.</td>
