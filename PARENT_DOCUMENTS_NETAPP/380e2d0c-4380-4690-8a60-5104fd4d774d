1. Log in to the host as root or using an account with sudo permission.

2. Run the following command: sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

root@SG:~ # sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

The result should be 0.

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 0

If the result is not 0, see the documentation for your operating system for changing sysctl settings. Then, change the value to 0 before continuing.

3. Enter the StorageGRID node container: storagegrid node enter node-name

4. Run the following command: sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

root@DC1-S1:~ # sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

The result should be 1. net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

If the result is not 1, this procedure does not apply. Contact technical support.

5. Exit the container: exit

root@DC1-S1:~ # exit

6. As root, edit the following file: /var/lib/storagegrid/settings/sysctl.d/net.conf.

sudo vi /var/lib/storagegrid/settings/sysctl.d/net.conf

7. Locate the following two lines and remove the comment tags. Then, save and close the file. net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 0

1303

net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 0

8. Run these commands to restart the StorageGRID container:

storagegrid node stop node-name

storagegrid node start node-name

Troubleshoot an external syslog server

The following table describes the error messages that might be related using to an external syslog server and lists corrective actions. root@DC1-S1:~ # sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6

The result should be 1. net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

If the result is not 1, this procedure does not apply. Contact technical support.

5. Exit the container: exit

root@DC1-S1:~ # exit

6. As root, edit the following file: /var/lib/storagegrid/settings/sysctl.d/net.conf.

storagegrid node start node-name

Troubleshoot an external syslog server

Configure audit messages and external syslog server Error message

Description and recommended actions

Cannot resolve hostname The FQDN you entered for the syslog server could not be resolved to an IP

address.

1. Check the hostname you entered. If you entered an IP address, make sure it is a valid IP address in W.X.Y.Z ("dotted decimal") notation.

2. Check that the DNS servers are configured correctly.

3. Confirm that each node can access the IP addresses for the DNS server.

Connection refused

A TCP or TLS connection to the syslog server was refused. There might be no service listening on the TCP or TLS port for the host, or a firewall might be blocking access.

1. Check that you entered the correct FQDN or IP address, port, and protocol for the syslog server.

2. Confirm that the host for the syslog service is running a syslog daemon that is listening on the specified port.

3. Confirm that a firewall is not blocking access to TCP/TLS connections from the nodes to the IP and port of the syslog server.

1304

Error message Network unreachable

Host unreachable

Connection timed out

Description and recommended actions

The syslog server is not on a directly attached subnet. A router returned an ICMP failure message to indicate it could not forward the test messages from the listed nodes to the syslog server.

1. Check that you entered the correct FQDN or IP address for the syslog server.

2. For each node listed, check the Grid Network Subnet List, the Admin Networks Subnet Lists, and the Client Network gateways. Confirm these are configured to route traffic to the syslog server over the expected network interface and gateway (Grid, Admin, or Client).

The syslog server is on a directly attached subnet (subnet used by the listed nodes for their Grid, Admin, or Client IP addresses). The nodes attempted to send test messages, but did not receive responses to ARP requests for the syslog serverâ€™s MAC address.

1. Check that you entered the correct FQDN or IP address for the syslog server. 2. Check that the host running the syslog service is up.

A TCP/TLS connection attempt was made, but no response was received from the syslog server for a long time. There might be a routing misconfiguration or a firewall might be dropping traffic without sending any response (a common configuration).

1. Check that you entered the correct FQDN or IP address for the syslog server.
