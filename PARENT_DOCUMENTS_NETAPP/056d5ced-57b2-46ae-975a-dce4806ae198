6. Click Next.

Review your configuration and complete installation You must carefully review the configuration information you have entered to ensure that the installation completes successfully.

Steps

1. View the Summary page.

2. Verify that all of the grid configuration information is correct. Use the Modify links on the Summary page to go back and correct any errors.

3. Click Install.

If a node is configured to use the Client Network, the default gateway for that node switches from the Grid Network to the Client Network when you click Install. If you lose connectivity, you must ensure that you are accessing the primary Admin Node through an accessible subnet. See Networking guidelines for details.

4. Click Download Recovery Package. When the installation progresses to the point where the grid topology is defined, you are prompted to download the Recovery Package file (.zip), and confirm that you can successfully access the contents of this file. You must download the Recovery Package file so that you can recover the StorageGRID system if one or more grid nodes fail. The installation continues in the background, but you can’t complete the installation and access the StorageGRID system until you download and verify this file.

5. Verify that you can extract the contents of the .zip file, and then save it in two safe, secure, and separate locations.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

6. Select the I have successfully downloaded and verified the Recovery Package file checkbox, and click Next. If the installation is still in progress, the status page appears. This page indicates the progress of the installation for each grid node.

When the Complete stage is reached for all grid nodes, the sign-in page for the Grid Manager appears.

7. Sign in to the Grid Manager using the "root" user and the password you specified during the installation. Post-installation guidelines

After completing grid node deployment and configuration, follow these guidelines for DHCP addressing and network configuration changes.

If DHCP was used to assign IP addresses, configure a DHCP reservation for each IP address on the networks being used.

You can only set up DHCP during the deployment phase. You can’t set up DHCP during configuration.

Nodes reboot when their IP addresses change, which can cause outages if a DHCP address change affects multiple nodes at the same time.

You must use the Change IP procedures if you want to change IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for a grid node. See Configure IP addresses.

If you make networking configuration changes, including routing and gateway changes, client connectivity to the primary Admin Node and other grid nodes might be lost. Depending on the networking changes applied, you might need to reestablish these connections.

Overview of the installation REST API StorageGRID provides the StorageGRID Installation API for performing installation tasks.

The API uses the Swagger open source API platform to provide the API documentation. Swagger allows both developers and non-developers to interact with the API in a user interface that illustrates how the API responds to parameters and options. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with standard web technologies and the JSON data format.
