GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG Value

STATIC or DHCP Best practice: Specify a value even if this node will not initially have a Client Network IP address. Then you can add a Client Network IP address later, without having to reconfigure the node on the host. Examples:

bond0.1003

ens423

CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE

Value

Interface (This is only supported value.)

CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC

Value

True or False

Set the key to "true" to cause the StorageGRID container to use the MAC address of the host target interface on the Client Network.

Best practice: In networks where promiscuous mode would be required, use the CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET_TYPE_INTERFACE_CLONE_MAC key instead. For more details on MAC cloning:

GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG Value

STATIC or DHCP

Defaults to STATIC if not specified.

GRID_NETWORK_GATEWAY

Value

IPv4 address of the local Grid Network gateway for this node, which must be on the subnet defined by GRID_NETWORK_IP and GRID_NETWORK_MASK. This value is ignored for DHCP-configured networks.

If the Grid Network is a single subnet with no gateway, use either the standard gateway address for the subnet (X.Y.Z.1) or this node’s GRID_NETWORK_IP value; either value will simplify potential future Grid Network expansions. GRID_NETWORK_IP

Value

IPv4 address of this node on the Grid Network. This key is only required when GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC; don’t specify it for other values.

Examples:

1.1.1.1

10.224.4.81

GRID_NETWORK_MAC

Value

The MAC address for the Grid Network interface in the container.

Must be 6 pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

Example: b2:9c:02:c2:27:30 Designation

Optional otherwise.

Optional

If omitted, a MAC address will be generated automatically.

GRID_NETWORK_MASK

Value

IPv4 netmask for this node on the Grid Network. Specify this key when GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC; don’t specify it for other values. Examples:

255.255.255.0

255.255.248.0

GRID_NETWORK_MTU

Value

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for this node on the Grid Network. Don’t specify if GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = DHCP. If specified, the value must be between 1280 and 9216. If omitted, 1500 is used.

If you want to use jumbo frames, set the MTU to a value suitable for jumbo frames, such as 9000. Otherwise, keep the default value.

IMPORTANT: The MTU value of the network must match the value configured on the switch port the node is connected to. Otherwise, network performance issues or packet loss might occur.

IMPORTANT: For the best network performance, all nodes should be configured with similar MTU values on their Grid Network interfaces. The Grid Network MTU mismatch alert is triggered if there is a significant difference in MTU settings for the Grid Network on individual nodes. The MTU values don’t have to be the same for all network types. Examples:

1500

8192

GRID_NETWORK_TARGET

Value

Designation

Required when GRID_NETWORK_IP is specified and GRID_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC.

Optional otherwise.

Designation

Optional

Designation

Name of the host device that you will use for Grid Network access by the StorageGRID node. Only network interface names are supported. Typically, you use a different interface name than what was specified for ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET or CLIENT_NETWORK_TARGET.
