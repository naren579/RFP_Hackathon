b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Run the following command:disable-saml

A message indicates that the command applies to this Admin Node only.

3. Confirm that you want to disable SSO.

A message indicates that single sign-on is disabled on the node.

4. From a web browser, access the Grid Manager on the same Admin Node.

351

The Grid Manager sign-in page is now displayed because SSO has been disabled.

5. Sign in with the username root and the local root user’s password.

6. If you disabled SSO temporarily because you needed to correct the SSO configuration: a. Select CONFIGURATION > Access control > Single sign-on.

b. Change the incorrect or out-of-date SSO settings.

c. Select Save.

Selecting Save from the Single Sign-on page automatically reenables SSO for the entire grid.

7. If you disabled SSO temporarily because you needed to access the Grid Manager for some other reason:

a. Perform whatever task or tasks you need to perform. b. Select Sign out, and close the Grid Manager.

c. Reenable SSO on the Admin Node. You can perform either of the following steps:

▪ Run the following command: enable-saml

A message indicates that the command applies to this Admin Node only.

Confirm that you want to enable SSO.

A message indicates that single sign-on is enabled on the node. ▪ Reboot the grid node: reboot

8. From a web browser, access the Grid Manager from the same Admin Node.

9. Confirm that the StorageGRID Sign in page appears and that you must enter your SSO credentials to access the Grid Manager.

Use grid federation

What is grid federation?

You can use grid federation to clone tenants and replicate their objects between two StorageGRID systems for disaster recovery.

What is a grid federation connection?

A grid federation connection is a bidirectional, trusted, and secure connection between Admin and Gateway Nodes in two StorageGRID systems. Workflow for grid federation

The workflow diagram summarize the steps for configuring a grid federation connection between two grids.

352

Considerations and requirements for grid federation connections

Both grids used for grid federation must be running StorageGRID 11.7 or later.

A grid can have one or more grid federation connections to other grids. Each grid federation connection is independent of any other connections. For example, if Grid 1 has one connection with Grid 2 and a second connection with Grid 3, there is no implied connection between Grid 2 and Grid 3.

Grid federation connections are bidirectional. After the connection is established, you can monitor and manage the connection from either grid.

At least one grid federation connection must exist before you can use account clone or cross-grid replication. Networking and IP address requirements

Grid federation connections can occur on the Grid Network, Admin Network, or Client Network.

A grid federation connection connects one grid to another grid. The configuration for each grid specifies a grid federation endpoint on the other grid that consists of Admin Nodes, Gateway Nodes, or both. You can use grid federation to clone tenants and replicate their objects between two StorageGRID systems for disaster recovery.
