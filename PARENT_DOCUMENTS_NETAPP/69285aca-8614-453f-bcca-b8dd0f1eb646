WOBJ

Swift Object

The Swift object identifier. Operations on accounts and containers don’t include this field. WUSR

Swift Account User

The Swift account username that uniquely identifies the client performing the transaction.

WPUT: Swift PUT

When a Swift client issues a PUT transaction, a request is made to create a new object or container. This message is issued by the server if the transaction is successful. Code

Field

Description

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block requested. If the CBID is unknown, this field is set to 0. Operations on containers don’t include this field.

CSIZ

Content Size

The size of the retrieved object in bytes. Operations on containers don’t include this field. HTRH

HTTP Request Header

List of logged HTTP request header names and values as selected during configuration.

X-Forwarded-For is automatically included if it is present in the request and if the X-Forwarded-For value is different from the request sender IP address (SAIP audit field).

MTME

Last Modified Time

The Unix timestamp, in microseconds, indicating when the object was last modified. RSLT

Result Code

Result of the PUT transaction. Result is always:

SUCS: successful

Expand a grid

Expand a grid: Overview

You can expand the capacity or capabilities of your StorageGRID system without interrupting system operations.

A StorageGRID expansion allows you to add:

Storage volumes to Storage Nodes

New grid nodes to an existing site

An entire new site

The reason you are performing the expansion determines how many new nodes of each type you must add and the location of those new nodes. For example, there are different node requirements if you are performing an expansion to increase storage capacity, add metadata capacity, or add redundancy or new capabilities.

Follow the steps for the type of expansion you’re performing:

Add storage volumes

Follow the steps for adding storage volumes to Storage Nodes. Add grid nodes

1. Follow the steps for adding grid nodes to an existing site.

2. Update the subnets.

3. Deploy grid nodes: ◦ Appliances ◦ VMware ◦ Linux

"Linux" refers to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, or Debian deployment. For a list of supported versions, see the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT).

Add storage capacity

Guidelines for adding object capacity

You can expand the object storage capacity of your StorageGRID system by adding storage volumes to existing Storage Nodes or by adding new Storage Nodes to existing sites. You must add storage capacity in a way that meets the requirements of your information lifecycle management (ILM) policy.
