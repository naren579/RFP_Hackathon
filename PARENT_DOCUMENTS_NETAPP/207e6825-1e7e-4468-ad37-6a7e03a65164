Do this

If both identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) are enabled

Select an existing federated group to have Root access permission for the tenant. No local users can sign in.

2. Select Create tenant.

A success message appears, and the new tenant is listed on the Tenants page. To learn how to view tenant details and monitor tenant activity, see Monitor tenant activity.

3. If you selected the Use grid federation connection permission for the tenant:

a. Confirm that an identical tenant was replicated to the other grid in the connection. The tenants on both

grids will have the same 20-digit account ID, name, description, quota, and permissions. If you see the error message "Tenant created without a clone," refer to the instructions in Troubleshoot grid federation errors.

b. If you provided a local root user password when defining root access, change the password for the

local root user for the replicated tenant.

A local root user can’t sign in to Tenant Manager on the destination grid until the password is changed.
