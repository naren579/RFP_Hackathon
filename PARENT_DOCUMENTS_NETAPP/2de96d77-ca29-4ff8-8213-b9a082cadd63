Use SNMP monitoring: Overview

If you want to monitor StorageGRID using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), you must configure the SNMP agent that is included with StorageGRID.

Configure the SNMP agent

Update the SNMP agent Capabilities

Each StorageGRID node runs an SNMP agent, or daemon, that provides a MIB. The StorageGRID MIB contains table and notification definitions for alerts and alarms. The MIB also contains system description information such as platform and model number for each node. Each StorageGRID node also supports a subset of MIB-II objects.

See Access MIB files if you want to download the MIB files on your grid nodes.

Initially, SNMP is disabled on all nodes. When you configure the SNMP agent, all StorageGRID nodes receive the same configuration.

The StorageGRID SNMP agent supports all three versions of the SNMP protocol. It provides read-only MIB access for queries, and it can send two types of event-driven notifications to a management system: Traps

Traps are notifications sent by the SNMP agent that don’t require acknowledgment by the management system. Traps serve to notify the management system that something has happened within StorageGRID, such as an alert being triggered.

Traps are supported in all three versions of SNMP. Informs

Informs are similar to traps, but they require acknowledgment by the management system. If the SNMP agent doesn’t receive an acknowledgment within a certain amount of time, it resends the inform until an acknowledgment is received or the maximum retry value has been reached.

Informs are supported in SNMPv2c and SNMPv3.

Trap and inform notifications are sent in the following cases:

A default or custom alert is triggered at any severity level. To suppress SNMP notifications for an alert, you must configure a silence for the alert. Alert notifications are sent by the preferred sender Admin Node. See Access MIB files if you want to download the MIB files on your grid nodes.

A default or custom alert is triggered at any severity level. To suppress SNMP notifications for an alert, you must configure a silence for the alert. Alert notifications are sent by the preferred sender Admin Node.

Each alert is mapped to one of three trap types based on the severity level of the alert: activeMinorAlert, activeMajorAlert, and activeCriticalAlert. For a list of the alerts that can trigger these traps, see the Alerts reference.

Certain alarms (legacy system) are triggered at specified severity levels or higher. SNMP notifications aren’t sent for every alarm or every alarm severity.

Limitations

StorageGRID supports read-only MIB access. Read-write access is not supported.

All nodes in the grid receive the same configuration.

SNMPv3: StorageGRID does not support the Transport Support Mode (TSM).

SNMPv3: The only authentication protocol supported is SHA (HMAC-SHA-96).

SNMPv3: The only privacy protocol supported is AES. Configure the SNMP agent

You can configure the StorageGRID SNMP agent to use a third-party SNMP management system for read-only MIB access and notifications.
