Column in the Storage shelves table

Description

Drawer status

The status of the drawers in the storage shelf. N/A if the shelf does not contain drawers.

Fan status

The overall status of the cooling fans in the storage shelf.

Drive slots The total number of drive slots in the storage shelf.

Data drives

The number of drives in the storage shelf that are used for data storage.

Data drive size

The effective size of one data drive in the storage shelf.

Cache drives

The number of drives in the storage shelf that are used as cache.

Cache drive size

The size of the smallest cache drive in the storage shelf. Normally, cache drives are all the same size. Configuration status

The configuration status of the storage shelf.

c. Confirm that all statuses are "Nominal."

If a status is not "Nominal," review any current alerts. You can also use SANtricity System Manager to learn more about some of these hardware values. See the instructions for installing and maintaining your appliance.

4. Select Network to view information for each network.

The Network Traffic graph provides a summary of overall network traffic. a. Review the Network Interfaces section.

Use the following table with the values in the Speed column in the Network Interfaces table to determine whether the 10/25-GbE network ports on the appliance were configured to use active/backup mode or LACP mode.

The values shown in the table assume all four links are used. Link mode

See Configure network links for more information about configuring the 10/25-GbE ports. b. Review the Network Communication section.

The Receive and Transmit tables show how many bytes and packets have been received and sent across each network as well as other receive and transmit metrics.

5. Select Storage to view graphs that show the percentages of storage used over time for object data and object metadata, as well as information about disk devices, volumes, and object stores.

a. Scroll down to view the amounts of available storage for each volume and object store.

The Worldwide Name for each disk matches the volume world-wide identifier (WWID) that appears

1031

when you view standard volume properties in SANtricity OS (the management software connected to the appliance’s storage controller).

To help you interpret disk read and write statistics related to volume mount points, the first portion of the name shown in the Name column of the Disk Devices table (that is, sdc, sdd, sde, and so on) matches the value shown in the Device column of the Volumes table. View information about appliance Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes

The Nodes page lists information about service health and all computational, disk device, and network resources for each services appliance that is used as an Admin Node or a Gateway Node. You can also see memory, storage hardware, network resources, network interfaces, network addresses, and receive and transmit data. Steps
