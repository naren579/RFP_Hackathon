Pool does not use HTTP for a container or bucket that requires HTTPS.

If the error message contains Get url: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection, verify that the network configuration allows Storage Nodes to access the service endpoint used for the Cloud Storage Pool.

For all other endpoint error messages, try one or more of the following:

Create an external container or bucket with the same name you entered for the Cloud Storage Pool, and try to save the new Cloud Storage Pool again.

Correct the container or bucket name you specified for the Cloud Storage Pool, and try to save the new Cloud Storage Pool again.

Error: Failed to parse CA certificate You might encounter this error when you try to create or edit a Cloud Storage Pool. The error occurs if StorageGRID could not parse the certificate you entered when configuring the Cloud Storage Pool.

To correct the issue, check the CA certificate you provided for issues. Error: A Cloud Storage Pool with this ID was not found

You might encounter this error when you try to edit or delete a Cloud Storage Pool. This error occurs if the endpoint returns a 404 response, which can mean either of the following:

The credentials used for the Cloud Storage Pool don’t have read permission for the bucket.

The bucket used for the Cloud Storage Pool does not include the x-ntap-sgws-cloud-pool-uuid marker file.

Try one or more of these steps to correct the issue:

Check that the user associated with the configured Access Key has the requisite permissions.

Edit the Cloud Storage Pool with credentials that have the requisite permissions. For all other endpoint error messages, try one or more of the following:

Create an external container or bucket with the same name you entered for the Cloud Storage Pool, and try to save the new Cloud Storage Pool again.

Correct the container or bucket name you specified for the Cloud Storage Pool, and try to save the new Cloud Storage Pool again.

Error: Failed to parse CA certificate You might encounter this error when you try to create or edit a Cloud Storage Pool. The error occurs if StorageGRID could not parse the certificate you entered when configuring the Cloud Storage Pool.

You might encounter this error when you try to edit or delete a Cloud Storage Pool. This error occurs if the endpoint returns a 404 response, which can mean either of the following:

The credentials used for the Cloud Storage Pool don’t have read permission for the bucket.

The bucket used for the Cloud Storage Pool does not include the x-ntap-sgws-cloud-pool-uuid marker file.

Try one or more of these steps to correct the issue:

Check that the user associated with the configured Access Key has the requisite permissions.

Edit the Cloud Storage Pool with credentials that have the requisite permissions.

If the permissions are correct, contact support.

Error: Could not check the content of the Cloud Storage Pool. Error from endpoint You might encounter this error when you try to delete a Cloud Storage Pool. This error indicates that some kind of connectivity or configuration issue is preventing StorageGRID from reading the contents of the Cloud Storage Pool bucket.

To correct the issue, review the error message from the endpoint.

Error: Objects have already been placed in this bucket

You might encounter this error when you try to delete a Cloud Storage Pool. You can’t delete a Cloud Storage Pool if it contains data that was moved there by ILM, data that was in the bucket before you configured the Cloud Storage Pool, or data that was put in the bucket by some other source after the Cloud Storage Pool was created.

Try one or more of these steps to correct the issue:

Follow the instructions for moving objects back to StorageGRID in "Lifecycle of a Cloud Storage Pool object."

645

• If you are certain the remaining objects were not placed in the Cloud Storage Pool by ILM, manually delete the objects from the bucket.

Never manually delete objects from a Cloud Storage Pool that might have been placed there by ILM. If you later attempt to access a manually deleted object from StorageGRID, the deleted object will not be found.

Error: Proxy encountered an external error while trying to reach the Cloud Storage Pool

You might encounter this error if you have configured a non-transparent storage proxy between Storage Nodes and the external S3 endpoint used for the Cloud Storage Pool. This error occurs if the external proxy server can’t reach the Cloud Storage Pool endpoint. For example, the DNS server might not be able to resolve the hostname or there might be an external networking issue.

Try one or more of these steps to correct the issue:

Check the settings for the Cloud Storage Pool (ILM > Storage pools).

Check the networking configuration of the storage proxy server.
