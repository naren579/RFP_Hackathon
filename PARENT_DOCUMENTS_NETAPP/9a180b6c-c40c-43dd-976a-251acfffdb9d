Configure S3 endpoint domain names

To support S3 virtual-hosted-style requests, you must use the Grid Manager to configure the list of S3 endpoint domain names that S3 clients connect to.

Using an IP address for an endpoint domain name is unsupported. Future releases will prevent this configuration.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

You have confirmed that a grid upgrade is not in progress.

Donâ€™t make any changes to the domain name configuration when a grid upgrade is in progress. About this task

To enable clients to use S3 endpoint domain names, you must do all of the following:

Use the Grid Manager to add the S3 endpoint domain names to the StorageGRID system.

Ensure that the certificate the client uses for HTTPS connections to StorageGRID is signed for all domain names that the client requires.
