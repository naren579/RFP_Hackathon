Outbound SNMP notifications and traps default to UDP port 162.

Note: This port is only required if SNMP is enabled and notification destinations are configured. If you plan to use SNMP, you can configure alternate ports.

Note: For information about using SNMP with StorageGRID, contact your NetApp account representative.

Used for connecting to an Active Directory or LDAP server for Identity Federation.

Used by web browsers and management API clients for accessing the Grid Manager and Tenant Manager.

Note: If you close Grid Manager ports 443 or 8443, any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list. See Configure firewall controls to configure privileged IP addresses.

Used by Admin Nodes connecting to Active Directory if single sign-on (SSO) is enabled. Used for accessing Amazon S3 from Archive Nodes.

Used for platform services messages sent to AWS or other external services that use HTTPS. Tenants can override the default HTTP port setting of 443 when creating an endpoint.

Cloud Storage Pools requests sent to AWS targets that use HTTPS. Grid administrators can override the default HTTPS port setting of 443 when configuring a Cloud Storage Pool.

Used by SMB-based audit export.

Note: This port is required only if SMB-based audit export is enabled.

Details

Used by NFS-based audit export ( rpc.mountd).

Note: This port is required only if NFS-based audit export is enabled.

Note: Support for NFS has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

SSH or console access is required for procedures with console steps. Optionally, you can use port 22 instead of 2022.

Used by NFS-based audit export (nfs).

Note: This port is required only if NFS-based audit export is enabled.

Note: Support for NFS has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Provides the multicast DNS (mDNS) service that is used for full-grid IP changes and for primary Admin Node discovery during installation, expansion, and recovery.

Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) external traffic from appliances configured for node encryption to the Key Management Server (KMS), unless a different port is specified on the KMS configuration page of the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. SSH on port 8022 grants access to the base operating system on appliance and virtual node platforms for support and troubleshooting. This port is not used for Linux-based (bare metal) nodes and is not required to be accessible between grid nodes or during normal operations.
