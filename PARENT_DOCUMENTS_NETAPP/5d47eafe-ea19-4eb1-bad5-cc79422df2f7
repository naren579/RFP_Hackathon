After completing grid node deployment and configuration, follow these guidelines for DHCP addressing and network configuration changes.

If DHCP was used to assign IP addresses, configure a DHCP reservation for each IP address on the networks being used.

You can only set up DHCP during the deployment phase. You can’t set up DHCP during configuration.

Nodes reboot when their IP addresses change, which can cause outages if a DHCP address change affects multiple nodes at the same time.

• You must use the Change IP procedures if you want to change IP addresses, subnet masks, and default

gateways for a grid node. See Configure IP addresses.

If you make networking configuration changes, including routing and gateway changes, client connectivity to the primary Admin Node and other grid nodes might be lost. Depending on the networking changes applied, you might need to reestablish these connections. Overview of the installation REST API

StorageGRID provides the StorageGRID Installation API for performing installation tasks.

The API uses the Swagger open source API platform to provide the API documentation. Swagger allows both developers and non-developers to interact with the API in a user interface that illustrates how the API responds to parameters and options. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with standard web technologies and the JSON data format.

Any API operations you perform using the API Docs webpage are live operations. Be careful not to create, update, or delete configuration data or other data by mistake.

Each REST API command includes the API’s URL, an HTTP action, any required or optional URL parameters, and an expected API response. StorageGRID Installation API

The StorageGRID Installation API is only available when you are initially configuring your StorageGRID system, and if you need to perform a primary Admin Node recovery. The Installation API can be accessed over HTTPS from the Grid Manager.

To access the API documentation, go to the installation web page on the primary Admin Node and select Help > API documentation from the menu bar.

The StorageGRID Installation API includes the following sections:

config — Operations related to the product release and versions of the API. You can list the product release version and the major versions of the API supported by that release.

grid — Grid-level configuration operations. You can get and update grid settings, including grid details, Grid Network subnets, grid passwords, and NTP and DNS server IP addresses. nodes — Node-level configuration operations. You can retrieve a list of grid nodes, delete a grid node, configure a grid node, view a grid node, and reset a grid node’s configuration.

provision — Provisioning operations. You can start the provisioning operation and view the status of the provisioning operation.

recovery — Primary Admin Node recovery operations. You can reset information, upload the Recover Package, start the recovery, and view the status of the recovery operation.

recovery-package — Operations to download the Recovery Package. • schemas — API schemas for advanced deployments • sites — Site-level configuration operations. You can create, view, delete, and modify a site.

Where to go next

After completing an installation, perform the required integration and configuration tasks.

You can perform the optional tasks as needed.

Required tasks

Configure VMware vSphere Hypervisor for automatic restart. You must configure the hypervisor to restart the virtual machines when the server restarts. Without an automatic restart, the virtual machines and grid nodes remain shut down after the server restarts. For details, see the VMware vSphere Hypervisor documentation.

Create a tenant account for each client protocol (Swift or S3) that will be used to store objects on your StorageGRID system. provision — Provisioning operations. You can start the provisioning operation and view the status of the provisioning operation.
