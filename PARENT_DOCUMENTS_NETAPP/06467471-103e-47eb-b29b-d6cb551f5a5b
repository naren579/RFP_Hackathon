The StorageGRID system can verify the integrity of object data on Storage Nodes, checking for both corrupt and missing objects.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Maintenance or Root access permission. About this task

Two verification processes work together to ensure data integrity:

Background verification runs automatically, continuously checking the correctness of object data.

Background verification automatically and continuously checks all Storage Nodes to determine if there are corrupt copies of replicated and erasure-coded object data. If problems are found, the StorageGRID system automatically attempts to replace the corrupt object data from copies stored elsewhere in the system. Background verification does not run on Archive Nodes or on objects in a Cloud Storage Pool.

The Unidentified corrupt object detected alert is triggered if the system detects a corrupt object that can’t be corrected automatically.

Object existence check can be triggered by a user to more quickly verify the existence (although not the correctness) of object data. Object existence check verifies whether all expected replicated copies of objects and erasure-coded fragments exist on a Storage Node. Object existence check provides a way to verify the integrity of storage devices, especially if a recent hardware issue could have affected data integrity.

You should review the results from background verifications and object existence checks regularly. Investigate any instances of corrupt or missing object data immediately to determine the root cause. Steps

1. Review the results from background verifications:

a. Select NODES > Storage Node > Objects.

b. Check the verification results:

▪ To check replicated object data verification, look at the attributes in the Verification section.

1224

▪ To check erasure-coded fragment verification, select Storage Node > ILM and look at the

attributes in the Erasure coding verification section.

Select the question mark

next to an attribute’s name to display help text.

2. Review the results from object existence check jobs: a. Select MAINTENANCE > Object existence check > Job history.

b. Scan the Missing object copies detected column. If any jobs resulted in 100 or more missing object

copies and the Objects lost alert has been triggered, contact technical support.

Monitor events

You can monitor events that are detected by a grid node, including custom events that you have created to track events that are logged to the syslog server. The Last Event message shown in the Grid Manager provides more information about the most recent event.

Event messages are also listed in the /var/local/log/bycast-err.log log file. See the Log files reference.

The SMTT (Total events) alarm can be repeatedly triggered by issues such as network problems, power outages or upgrades. This section has information about investigating events so that you can better understand why these alarms have occurred. If an event occurred because of a known issue, it is safe to reset the event counters. Steps

1. Review the system events for each grid node:

a. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

b. Select site > grid node > SSM > Events > Overview > Main. Select the question mark

next to an attribute’s name to display help text.

2. Review the results from object existence check jobs: a. Select MAINTENANCE > Object existence check > Job history.

b. Scan the Missing object copies detected column. If any jobs resulted in 100 or more missing object

copies and the Objects lost alert has been triggered, contact technical support.
