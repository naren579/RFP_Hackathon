If a major or minor Low object data storage alert is triggered, you should perform an expansion procedure as soon as possible. Steps

1. Select ALERTS > Current.

The Alerts page appears.

2. From the table of alerts, expand the Low object data storage alert group, if required, and select the alert you want to view.

Select the alert, not the heading for a group of alerts.

3. Review the details in the dialog box, and note the following:

Time triggered ◦ The name of the site and node ◦ The current values of the metrics for this alert

4. Select NODES > Storage Node or Site > Storage.

5. Position your cursor over the Storage Used - Object Data graph.

The following values are shown:

Used (%): The percentage of the Total usable space that has been used for object data. ◦ Used: The amount of the Total usable space that has been used for object data. ◦ Replicated data: An estimate of the amount of replicated object data on this node, site, or grid. ◦ Erasure-coded data: An estimate of the amount of erasure-coded object data on this node, site, or

1273

grid. Total: The total amount of usable space on this node, site, or grid.

The Used value is the storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes metric.

6. Select the time controls above the graph to view storage use over different time periods. The Alerts page appears.

grid. Total: The total amount of usable space on this node, site, or grid.

The Used value is the storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes metric.

6. Select the time controls above the graph to view storage use over different time periods.

Looking at storage use over time can help you understand how much storage was used before and after the alert was triggered and can help you estimate how long it might take for the node’s remaining space to become full.

7. As soon as possible, add storage capacity to your grid.

You can add storage volumes (LUNs) to existing Storage Nodes, or you can add new Storage Nodes.

If you use custom values for storage volume watermarks, you might need to resolve the Low read-only watermark override alert. If possible, you should update your system to start using the optimized values.

In previous releases, the three storage volume watermarks were global settings — the same values applied to every storage volume on every Storage Node. Starting in StorageGRID 11.6, the software can optimize these watermarks for each storage volume, based on the size of the Storage Node and the relative capacity of the volume.

When you upgrade to StorageGRID 11.6 or higher, optimized read-only and read-write watermarks are automatically applied to all storage volumes, unless either of the following is true:

Your system is close to capacity and would not be able to accept new data if optimized watermarks were applied. StorageGRID will not change watermark settings in this case. You previously set any of the storage volume watermarks to a custom value. StorageGRID will not override

custom watermark settings with optimized values. However, StorageGRID might trigger the Low read-only watermark override alert if your custom value for the Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark is too small. Understand the alert

If you use custom values for storage volume watermarks, the Low read-only watermark override alert might be triggered for one or more Storage Nodes.

Each instance of the alert indicates that the custom value of the Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark is smaller than the minimum optimized value for that Storage Node. If you continue to use the custom setting, the Storage Node might run critically low on space before it can safely transition to the read-only state. Some storage volumes might become inaccessible (automatically unmounted) when the node reaches capacity.
