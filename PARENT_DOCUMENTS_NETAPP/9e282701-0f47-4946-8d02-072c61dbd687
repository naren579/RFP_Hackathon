6. Installing the StorageGRID host service

7. Creating StorageGRID node configuration files in /etc/storagegrid/nodes

8. Validating StorageGRID node configuration files 9. Starting the StorageGRID host service

Example Ansible role and playbook

Example Ansible role and playbook are supplied with the installation archive in the /extras folder. The Ansible playbook shows how the storagegrid role prepares the hosts and installs StorageGRID onto the target servers. You can customize the role or playbook as necessary.

Automate the configuration of StorageGRID

After deploying the grid nodes, you can automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You know the location of the following files from the installation archive. Filename

Description

configure-storagegrid.py You can automate these tasks:

1. Installing Linux

2. Configuring Linux

3. Configuring host network interfaces to meet StorageGRID requirements

4. Configuring host storage to meet StorageGRID requirements

Automate the configuration of StorageGRID

After deploying the grid nodes, you can automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You know the location of the following files from the installation archive. Filename

Description

configure-storagegrid.py

Python script used to automate the configuration

configure-storagegrid.sample.json

Example configuration file for use with the script

configure-storagegrid.blank.json

Blank configuration file for use with the script

You have created a configure-storagegrid.json configuration file. To create this file, you can modify

the example configuration file (configure-storagegrid.sample.json) or the blank configuration file (configure-storagegrid.blank.json). About this task

You can use the configure-storagegrid.py Python script and the configure-storagegrid.json configuration file to automate the configuration of your StorageGRID system.

You can also configure the system using the Grid Manager or the Installation API.

Steps

1. Log in to the Linux machine you are using to run the Python script.

2. Change to the directory where you extracted the installation archive. For example:

cd StorageGRID-Webscale-version/platform

where platform is debs, rpms, or vsphere.

3. Run the Python script and use the configuration file you created.

For example:

./configure-storagegrid.py ./configure-storagegrid.json --start-install

Result

A Recovery Package .zip file is generated during the configuration process, and it is downloaded to the directory where you are running the installation and configuration process. You must back up the Recovery Package file so that you can recover the StorageGRID system if one or more grid nodes fails. For example, copy it to a secure, backed up network location and to a secure cloud storage location.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

If you specified that random passwords should be generated, open the Passwords.txt file and look for the passwords required to access your StorageGRID system. ###################################################################### ##### The StorageGRID "recovery package" has been downloaded as: ##### ##### ./sgws-recovery-package-994078-rev1.zip ##### ##### Safeguard this file as it will be needed in case of a ##### ##### StorageGRID node recovery. ##### ######################################################################

Your StorageGRID system is installed and configured when a confirmation message is displayed.

Create node configuration files for Ubuntu or Debian deployments

Node configuration files are small text files that provide the information the StorageGRID host service needs to start a node and connect it to the appropriate network and block storage resources. Node configuration files are used for virtual nodes and arenâ€™t used for appliance nodes. Location for node configuration files
