This value indicates the reliability and stability of the time source that NTP on the local server is using as its reference.

If an alarm is triggered, it can be an indication that the time source’s oscillator is defective, or that there is a problem with the WAN link to the time source.

If the value of NTP Status is Not Running, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered if the power of a StorageGRID appliance deviates from the recommended operating voltage.

Check the status of Power Supply A or B to determine which power supply is operating abnormally.

If necessary, replace the power supply.

After the objects are automatically restored by the StorageGRID system, the quarantined objects can be removed from the quarantine directory.

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select site > Storage Node > LDR > Verification > Configuration > Main.

3. Select Delete Quarantined Objects.

4. Click Apply Changes.

The quarantined objects are removed, and the count is reset to zero. An alarm indicates that outbound replication is not possible: storage is in a state where objects can’t be retrieved. An alarm is triggered if outbound replication is disabled manually. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > LDR > Replication > Configuration.

An alarm is triggered if the LDR service is unavailable for replication. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > LDR > Storage. Service

Can have a value of Over Y% RAM, where Y represents the percentage of memory being used by the server.

Figures under 80% are normal. Over 90% is considered a problem.

If memory usage is high for a single service, monitor the situation and investigate.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered if power supply A in a StorageGRID appliance deviates from the recommended operating voltage.

If necessary, replace power supply A.

An alarm is triggered if power supply B in a StorageGRID appliance deviates from the recommended operating voltage.

If necessary, replace the power supply B.

Only available for Archive Nodes with a Target Type of Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM).

If the value of Tivoli Storage Manager State is Offline, check Tivoli Storage Manager Status and resolve any problems. Bring the component back online. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.
