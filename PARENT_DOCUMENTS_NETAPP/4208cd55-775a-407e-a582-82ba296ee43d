VSID

Version ID

The version ID of a new object created in a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets and objects in unversioned buckets donâ€™t include this field.

The ORLM audit message can be issued more than once for a single object. For instance, it is issued

1361

whenever one of the following events occur:

ILM rules for the object are satisfied forever.

ILM rules for the object are satisfied for this epoch.

ILM rules have deleted the object.

The background verification process detects that a copy of replicated object data is corrupt. The StorageGRID system performs an ILM evaluation to replace the corrupt object.
