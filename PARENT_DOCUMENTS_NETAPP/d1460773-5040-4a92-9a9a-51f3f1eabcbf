Permanent deletion when bucket versioning is disabled: When you overwrite or delete an object in a bucket with versioning disabled, the operation is permanent. See Change object versioning for a bucket. Manage S3 platform services

Manage platform services: Overview

StorageGRID platform services can help you implement a hybrid cloud strategy by allowing you to send event notifications and copies of S3 objects and object metadata to external destinations.

If the use of platform services is allowed for your tenant account, you can configure the following services for any S3 bucket: CloudMirror replication

Use StorageGRID CloudMirror replication service to mirror specific objects from a StorageGRID bucket to a specified external destination.

For example, you might use CloudMirror replication to mirror specific customer records into Amazon S3 and then leverage AWS services to perform analytics on your data.

826

CloudMirror replication is not supported if the source bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled. Notifications

Use per-bucket event notifications to send notifications about specific actions performed on objects to a specified external Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

For example, you could configure alerts to be sent to administrators about each object added to a bucket, where the objects represent log files associated with a critical system event.

Although event notification can be configured on a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, the S3 Object Lock metadata (including Retain Until Date and Legal Hold status) of the objects will not be included in the notification messages. Search integration service

Use the search integration service to send S3 object metadata to a specified Elasticsearch index where the metadata can be searched or analyzed using the external service.

For example, you could configure your buckets to send S3 object metadata to a remote Elasticsearch service. You could then use Elasticsearch to perform searches across buckets, and perform sophisticated analyses of patterns present in your object metadata.

Because the target location for platform services is typically external to your StorageGRID deployment, platform services give you the power and flexibility that comes from using external storage resources, notification services, and search or analysis services for your data. Any combination of platform services can be configured for a single S3 bucket. For example, you could configure both the CloudMirror service and notifications on a StorageGRID S3 bucket so that you can mirror specific objects to the Amazon Simple Storage Service, while sending a notification about each such object to a third party monitoring application to help you track your AWS expenses.

The use of platform services must be enabled for each tenant account by a StorageGRID administrator using the Grid Manager or the Grid Management API.
