If you plan to use an external (third-party) load balancer endpoint, you have the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), port, and certificate for that load balancer. Configure any grid federation connections

If you want to allow the S3 tenant to clone account data and replicate bucket objects to another grid using a grid federation connection, confirm the following before starting the wizard:

You have configured the grid federation connection.

The status of the connection is Connected.

You have Root access permission.

Access and complete the S3 setup wizard

You can use the S3 setup wizard to configure StorageGRID for use with an S3 application. The setup wizard provides the values the application needs to access a StorageGRID bucket and to save objects.

Before you begin

You have the Root access permission.

You have reviewed the considerations and requirements for using the wizard. Access the wizard

Steps

1. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

2. If the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard banner appears on the dashboard, select the link in the banner. If the banner no longer appears, select the help icon from the header bar in the Grid Manager and select FabricPool and S3 setup wizard.

3. In the S3 application section of the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard page, select Configure now. Step 1 of 6: Configure HA group

An HA group is a collection of nodes that each contain the StorageGRID Load Balancer service. An HA group can contain Gateway Nodes, Admin Nodes, or both.

You can use an HA group to help keep the S3 data connections available. If the active interface in the HA group fails, a backup interface can manage the workload with little impact to S3 operations.

1. If you plan to use an external load balancer, you don’t need to create an HA group. Select Skip this step and go to Step 2 of 6: Configure load balancer endpoint.

2. To use the StorageGRID load balancer, you can create a new HA group or use an existing HA group.

Create HA group

a. To create a new HA group, select Create HA group.

b. For the Enter details step, complete the following fields. Field

Description

HA group name

A unique display name for this HA group.

Description (optional)

The description of this HA group.

c. For the Add interfaces step, select the node interfaces you want to use in this HA group.

Use the column headers to sort the rows, or enter a search term to locate interfaces more quickly.

You can select one or more nodes, but you can select only one interface for each node.

d. For the Prioritize interfaces step, determine the Primary interface and any backup interfaces for this HA group.

Drag rows to change the values in the Priority order column.

The first interface in the list is the Primary interface. The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs.

If the HA group includes more than one interface and the active interface fails, the virtual IP (VIP) addresses move to the first backup interface in the priority order. If that interface fails, the VIP addresses move to the next backup interface, and so on. When failures are resolved, the VIP addresses move back to the highest priority interface available.

e. For the Enter IP addresses step, complete the following fields. Field

Description

Subnet CIDR

The address of the VIP subnet in CIDR notation — an IPv4 address followed by a slash and the subnet length (0-32).

The network address must not have any host bits set. For example, 192.16.0.0/22.

Gateway IP address (optional)
