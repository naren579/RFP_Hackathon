Description

Global (default)

Clients can access the endpoint using the IP address of any Gateway Node or Admin Node, the virtual IP (VIP) address of any HA group on any network, or a corresponding FQDN.

Use the Global setting (default) unless you need to restrict the accessibility of this endpoint.

Virtual IPs of HA groups Clients must use a virtual IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of an HA group to access this endpoint.

Endpoints with this binding mode can all use the same port number, as long as the HA groups you select for the endpoints don’t overlap.

Node interfaces

Clients must use the IP addresses (or corresponding FQDNs) of selected node interfaces to access this endpoint.

481

Mode

Description Node type

Based on the type of node you select, clients must use either the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Admin Node or the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Gateway Node to access this endpoint.

4. For the Tenant access step, select one of the following:

Field

Description

Allow all tenants (default)

All tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

Allow selected tenants

Only the selected tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

Block selected tenants

The selected tenant accounts can’t use this endpoint to access their buckets. All other tenants can use this endpoint.

5. For the Attach certificate step, select one of the following: Field

Description

Upload certificate (recommended) Virtual IPs of HA groups Clients must use a virtual IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of an HA group to access this endpoint.

Endpoints with this binding mode can all use the same port number, as long as the HA groups you select for the endpoints don’t overlap.

Node interfaces

Clients must use the IP addresses (or corresponding FQDNs) of selected node interfaces to access this endpoint.

481

Mode

Description Node type

Based on the type of node you select, clients must use either the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Admin Node or the IP address (or corresponding FQDN) of any Gateway Node to access this endpoint.

4. For the Tenant access step, select one of the following:

Field

Description

Allow all tenants (default)

All tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

Allow selected tenants

Only the selected tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

Block selected tenants

The selected tenant accounts can’t use this endpoint to access their buckets. All other tenants can use this endpoint.

5. For the Attach certificate step, select one of the following: Field

Description

Upload certificate (recommended)

Use this option to upload a CA-signed server certificate, certificate private key, and optional CA bundle.

Generate certificate

Use this option to generate a self-signed certificate. See Configure load balancer endpoints for details of what to enter. Use StorageGRID S3 and Swift certificate

Use this option only if you have already uploaded or generated a custom version of the StorageGRID global certificate. See Configure S3 and Swift API certificates for details.

6. Select Finish to return to the S3 setup wizard.

7. Select Continue to go to the tenant and bucket step.

Changes to an endpoint certificate can take up to 15 minutes to be applied to all nodes.

Use existing load balancer endpoint Steps

1. To use an existing endpoint, select its name from the Select a load balancer endpoint.

2. Select Continue to go to the tenant and bucket step.

Use external load balancer

Steps

1. To use an external load balancer, complete the following fields.

482

Field

Description

FQDN

The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the external load balancer. Port

The port number that the S3 application will use to connect to the external load balancer.

Certificate

Copy the server certificate for the external load balancer and paste it into this field.

2. Select Continue to go to the tenant and bucket step. Step 3 of 6: Create tenant and bucket

A tenant is an entity that can use S3 applications to store and retrieve objects in StorageGRID. Each tenant has its own users, access keys, buckets, objects, and a specific set of capabilities. You must create the tenant before you can create the bucket that the S3 application will use to store its objects.

A bucket is a container used to store a tenant’s objects and object metadata. Although some tenants might have many buckets, the wizard helps you to create a tenant and a bucket in the quickest and easiest way. You can use the Tenant Manager later to add any additional buckets you need.

You can create a new tenant for this S3 application to use. Optionally, you can also create a bucket for the new tenant. Finally, you can allow the wizard to create the S3 access keys for the tenant’s root user.

For details about this task, see Create tenant account and Create S3 bucket. Steps

1. Select Create tenant.
