while all smaller objects are stored at DC2, each 1 GB part of a 10-part multipart upload is stored at
DC2 at ingest. However, when ILM is evaluated for the object as a whole, all parts of the object are
moved to DC1.

• As required, you can use server-side encryption with multipart uploads. To use SSE (server-side encryption
with StorageGRID-managed keys), you include the request header x-amz-server-side-encryption
in the CreateMultipartUpload request only. To use SSE-C (server-side encryption with customer-provided
keys), you specify the same three encryption key request headers in the CreateMultipartUpload request
and in each subsequent UploadPart request.<br>
