If the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered when an LDR or ARC service loses connection to a DDS service. If this occurs, ingest or retrieve transactions can’t be processed. If the unavailability of DDS services is only a brief transient issue, transactions can be delayed.

Check and restore connections to a DDS service to clear this alarm and return the service to full functionality.

Only available for Archive Nodes with a Target Type of Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3). If the ACTS attribute for the Archive Node is set to Read-Only Enabled or Read-Write Disabled, you must set the attribute to Read-Write Enabled.

If a major alarm is triggered due to an authentication failure, verify the credentials associated with destination bucket and update values, if necessary.

If a major alarm is triggered due to any other reason, contact technical support.

If an alarm is triggered, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > ADC > Overview > Main and ADC > Alarms > Main to determine the cause of the alarm.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of ADC State is Standby, continue monitoring the service and if the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of ADC State is Offline, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

Only available for Archive Node’s with a Target Type of Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM).

If the value of Retrieve State is Waiting for Target, check the TSM middleware server and ensure that it is operating correctly. If the Archive Node has just been added to the StorageGRID system, ensure that the Archive Node’s connection to the targeted external archival storage system is configured correctly.

If the value of Archive Retrieve State is Offline, attempt to update the state to Online. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > ARC > Retrieve > Configuration > Main, select Archive Retrieve State > Online, and click Apply Changes.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of Retrieve Status is Target Error, check the targeted external archival storage system for errors. If the value of Archive Retrieve Status is Session Lost, check the targeted external archival storage system to ensure it is online and operating correctly. Check the network connection with the target.

If the value of Archive Retrieve Status is Unknown Error, contact technical support.

If the number of inbound attribute sessions on an attribute relay grows too large, it can be an indication that the StorageGRID system has become unbalanced. Under normal conditions, attribute sessions should be evenly distributed amongst ADC services. An imbalance can lead to performance issues.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

The ADC service has a high number of attribute sessions, and is becoming overloaded. If this alarm is triggered, contact technical support.

Check network connectivity with the NMS service to ensure that the service can contact the attribute repository.

If this alarm is triggered and network connectivity is good, contact technical support.

If audit messages can’t be immediately forwarded to an audit relay or repository, the messages are stored in a disk queue. If the disk queue becomes full, outages can occur.
