Create traffic classification policies

You can create traffic classification policies if you want to monitor, and optionally limit network traffic by bucket, bucket regex, CIDR, load balancer endpoint, or tenant. Optionally, you can set limits for a policy based on bandwidth, the number of concurrent requests, or the request rate.

You have the Root access permission.

You have created any load balancer endpoints you want to match.

You have created any tenants you want to match. Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Network > Traffic classification.

2. Select Create.

3. Enter a name and a description (optional) for the policy and select Continue.

For example, describe what this traffic classification policy applies to and what it will limit.

4. Select Add rule and specify the following details to create one or more matching rules for the policy. Any policy that you create should have at least one matching rule. Select Continue. Field

Description

Type

Select the types of traffic that the matching rule applies to. Traffic types are bucket, bucket regex, CIDR, load balancer endpoint, and tenant. Match value

Enter the value that matches the selected Type.

Bucket: Enter one or more bucket names.

Bucket regex: Enter one or more regular expressions used to match a set of bucket names.

The regular expression is unanchored. Use the ^ anchor to match at the beginning of the bucket name, and use the $ anchor to match at the end of the name. Regular expression matching supports a subset of PCRE (Perl compatible regular expression) syntax.

CIDR: Enter one or more IPv4 subnets, in CIDR notation, that matches the desired subnet.

Load balancer endpoint: Select an endpoint name. These are the load balancer endpoints you defined on the Configure load balancer endpoints.

Tenant: Tenant matching uses the access key ID. If the request does not contain an access key ID (for example, anonymous access), then the ownership of the bucket accessed is used to determine the tenant.

Field

Description Inverse match

If you want to match all network traffic except traffic consistent with the Type and Match Value just defined, select the Inverse match checkbox. Otherwise, leave the checkbox cleared.

For example, if you want this policy to apply to all but one of the load balancer endpoints, specify the load balancer endpoint to be excluded, and select Inverse match.

For a policy containing multiple matchers where at least one is an inverse matcher, be careful not to create a policy that matches all requests.

5. Optionally, select Add a limit and select the following details to add one or more limits to control the network traffic matched by a rule.

StorageGRID collects metrics even if you donâ€™t add any limits, so you can understand traffic trends. Field

Description

Type

The type of limit you want to apply to the network traffic matched by the rule. For example, you can limit bandwidth or request rate.
