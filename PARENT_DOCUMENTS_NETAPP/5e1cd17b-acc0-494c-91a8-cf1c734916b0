Description

Action required Not connected - Unknown

Requires immediate attention. Select each alert and follow the recommended actions.

For an unknown reason, a node is disconnected or services on the node are unexpectedly down. For example, a service on the node might be stopped, or the node might have lost its network connection because of a power failure or unexpected outage.

For example, you might need to restart a service that has stopped or restart the host for the node.

Note: A node might appear as Unknown during managed shutdown operations. You can ignore the Unknown state in these cases.

The Unable to communicate with node alert might also be triggered. Other alerts might also be active.

Action required

Not connected - Administratively down

Determine if any alerts are affecting this node.

For an expected reason, node is not connected to grid.

If one or more alerts are active, Select each alert and follow the recommended actions. For example, the node, or services on the node, has been gracefully shut down, the node is rebooting, or the software is being upgraded. One or more alerts might also be active.

Based on the underlying issue, these nodes often go back online with no intervention.

If a node is disconnected from the grid, it might have an underlying alert, but only the "Not connected" icon appears. To see the active alerts for a node, select the node. Alert icons

If there is an active alert for a node, one of the following icons appears next to the node name:

Critical: An abnormal condition exists that has stopped the normal operations of a StorageGRID node or service. You must address the underlying issue immediately. Service disruption and loss of data might result if the issue is not resolved.

Major: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current operations or approaching the threshold The Unable to communicate with node alert might also be triggered. Other alerts might also be active.

Major: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current operations or approaching the threshold

for a critical alert. You should investigate major alerts and address any underlying issues to ensure that the abnormal condition does not stop the normal operation of a StorageGRID node or service.

Minor: The system is operating normally, but an abnormal condition exists that could affect the system’s

ability to operate if it continues. You should monitor and resolve minor alerts that don’t clear on their own to ensure they don’t result in a more serious problem. View details for a system, site, or node
