If the Drive Security feature is enabled for an SG5700 or SG6000 storage appliance, you can use SANtricity System Manager to create and manage the security key. The key is required to access the data on the secured drives.

You enable the Stored object encryption option in the Grid Manager. When enabled, any new objects that aren’t encrypted at the bucket level or at the object level are encrypted during ingest.

You issue a PutBucketEncryption request to enable encryption for the bucket. Any new objects that aren’t encrypted at the object level are encrypted during ingest.

You issue an S3 request to store an object and include the x-amz- server-side-encryption request header.

Applies to Storage appliances that have Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or self-encrypting drives. All data on the secured drives is protected against physical loss or removal from the data center. Can’t be used with some storage appliances or with any services appliances.

Newly ingested S3 and Swift object data.

Existing stored objects aren’t encrypted. Object metadata and other sensitive data aren’t encrypted.

S3 object server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE- C)

You issue an S3 request to store an object and include three request headers.

Use server-side encryption

External volume or datastore encryption

You use an encryption method outside of StorageGRID to encrypt an entire volume or datastore, if your deployment platform supports it.

All object data, metadata, and system configuration data, assuming every volume or datastore is encrypted.

An external encryption method provides tighter control over encryption algorithms and keys. Can be combined with the other methods listed. Object encryption outside of StorageGRID

You use an encryption method outside of StorageGRID to encrypt object data and metadata before they are ingested into StorageGRID.

Object data and metadata only (system configuration data is not encrypted).

An external encryption method provides tighter control over encryption algorithms and keys. Can be combined with the other methods listed. Amazon Simple Storage Service - Developer Guide: Protecting data using client-side encryption

Use multiple encryption methods

Depending on your requirements, you can use more than one encryption method at a time. For example:

You can use a KMS to protect appliance nodes and also use the drive security feature in SANtricity System Manager to "double encrypt" data on the self-encrypting drives in the same appliances.

You can use a KMS to secure data on appliance nodes and also use the Stored object encryption option to encrypt all objects when they are ingested.

If only a small portion of your objects require encryption, consider controlling encryption at the bucket or individual object level instead. Enabling multiple levels of encryption has an additional performance cost.
