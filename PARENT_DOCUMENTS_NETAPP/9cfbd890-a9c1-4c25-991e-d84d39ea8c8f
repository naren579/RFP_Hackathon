Note: The Task ID is assigned at the time that a grid task is generated, not the time that it is submitted. It is possible for a given grid task to be submitted multiple times, and in this case the Task ID field is not sufficient to uniquely link the Submitted, Started, and Ended audit messages. RSLT

Result

The result. This field has only one value:

SUCS: The grid task was started successfully.

GTSU: Grid Task Submitted

This audit message indicates that a grid task has been submitted to the CMN service.

Field

Description

TSID

Task ID

Uniquely identifies a generated grid task and allows the task to be managed over its lifecycle.

Note: The Task ID is assigned at the time that a grid task is generated, not the time that it is submitted. It is possible for a given grid task to be submitted multiple times, and in this case the Task ID field is not sufficient to uniquely link the Submitted, Started, and Ended audit messages. TTYP

Task Type

The type of grid task.

TVER

Task Version

A number indicating the version of the grid task.

TDSC

Task Description A human-readable description of the grid task.

VATS

Valid After Timestamp

The earliest time (UINT64 microseconds from January 1, 1970 - UNIX time) at which the grid task is valid. VBTS

Valid Before Timestamp

The latest time (UINT64 microseconds from January 1, 1970 - UNIX time) at which the grid task is valid.

TSRC

Source

The source of the task:

TXTB: The grid task was submitted through the StorageGRID system as a signed text block.

GRID: The grid task was submitted through the internal Grid Task Submission Service. ACTV

Activation Type

The type of activation:

AUTO: The grid task was submitted for automatic activation. Note: The Task ID is assigned at the time that a grid task is generated, not the time that it is submitted. It is possible for a given grid task to be submitted multiple times, and in this case the Task ID field is not sufficient to uniquely link the Submitted, Started, and Ended audit messages. TTYP

Task Type

The type of grid task.

TVER

Task Version

A number indicating the version of the grid task.

TDSC

Task Description A human-readable description of the grid task.

VATS

Valid After Timestamp

TSRC

Source

The source of the task:

TXTB: The grid task was submitted through the StorageGRID system as a signed text block.

GRID: The grid task was submitted through the internal Grid Task Submission Service. ACTV

Activation Type

The type of activation:

AUTO: The grid task was submitted for automatic activation.

PEND: The grid task was submitted into the pending table. This is the only possibility for the TXTB source.

RSLT

Result

The result of the submission:

SUCS: The grid task was submitted successfully.

FAIL: The task has been moved directly to the historical table. IDEL: ILM Initiated Delete

This message is generated when ILM starts the process of deleting an object.

The IDEL message is generated in either of these situations:

For objects in compliant S3 buckets: This message is generated when ILM starts the process of auto- deleting an object because its retention period has expired (assuming the auto-delete setting is enabled

1355

and legal hold is off).

For objects in non-compliant S3 buckets or Swift containers. This message is generated when ILM starts the process of deleting an object because no placement instructions in the active ILM policies currently apply to the object. Code

Field

Description

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The CBID of the object.

CMPA

Compliance: Auto delete

For objects in compliant S3 buckets only. 0 (false) or 1 (true), indicating whether a compliant object should be deleted automatically when its retention period ends, unless the bucket is under a legal hold. CMPL

Compliance: Legal hold

For objects in compliant S3 buckets only. 0 (false) or 1 (true), indicating whether the bucket is currently under a legal hold.

CMPR

Compliance: Retention period

For objects in compliant S3 buckets only. The length of the object’s retention period in minutes.

CTME

Compliance: Ingest time

For objects in compliant S3 buckets only. The object’s ingest time. You can add the retention period in minutes to this value to determine when the object can be deleted from the bucket. DMRK

Delete Marker Version ID

The version ID of the delete marker created when deleting an object from a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets don’t include this field.

CSIZ

Content size

The size of the object in bytes.

LOCS

Locations

The storage location of object data within the StorageGRID system. The value for LOCS is "" if the object has no locations (for example, it has been deleted).
