metrics are also shown on the Nodes pages.)

Alarms: When attributes reach defined threshold values, StorageGRID alarms (legacy system) are triggered at specific severity levels.

Grid Topology tree: Attribute values are shown in the Grid Topology tree (SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology).

Events: System events occur when certain attributes record an error or fault condition for a node, including errors such as network errors. Attribute values

Attributes are reported on a best-effort basis and are approximately correct. Attribute updates can be lost under some circumstances, such as the crash of a service or the failure and rebuild of a grid node.

In addition, propagation delays might slow the reporting of attributes. Updated values for most attributes are sent to the StorageGRID system at fixed intervals. It can take several minutes before an update is visible in the system, and two attributes that change more or less simultaneously can be reported at slightly different times. Review support metrics

When troubleshooting an issue, you can work with technical support to review detailed metrics and charts for your StorageGRID system.

About this task

The Metrics page allows you to access the Prometheus and Grafana user interfaces. Prometheus is open- source software for collecting metrics. Grafana is open-source software for metrics visualization.

The tools available on the Metrics page are intended for use by technical support. Some features and menu items within these tools are intentionally non-functional and are subject to change. See the list of commonly used Prometheus metrics. Steps

1. As directed by technical support, select SUPPORT > Tools > Metrics.

An example of the Metrics page is shown here:

2. To query the current values of StorageGRID metrics and to view graphs of the values over time, click the link in the Prometheus section.

The Prometheus interface appears. You can use this interface to execute queries on the available StorageGRID metrics and to graph StorageGRID metrics over time.

Metrics that include private in their names are intended for internal use only and are subject to change between StorageGRID releases without notice.

3. To access pre-constructed dashboards containing graphs of StorageGRID metrics over time, click the links in the Grafana section.

The Grafana interface for the link you selected appears.

1235 Run diagnostics

When troubleshooting an issue, you can work with technical support to run diagnostics on your StorageGRID system and review the results.

Before you begin

You have specific access permissions. About this task

The Diagnostics page performs a set of diagnostic checks on the current state of the grid. Each diagnostic check can have one of three statuses:

1236

Normal: All values are within the normal range.

Attention: One or more of the values are outside of the normal range.

Caution: One or more of the values are significantly outside of the normal range.

Diagnostic statuses are independent of current alerts and might not indicate operational issues with the grid. For example, a diagnostic check might show Caution status even if no alert has been triggered.
