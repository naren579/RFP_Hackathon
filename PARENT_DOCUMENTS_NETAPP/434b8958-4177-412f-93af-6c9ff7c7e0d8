1036 a. Review the Network Interfaces section.

Use the following table with the values in the Speed column in the Network Interfaces table to determine whether the four 40/100-GbE network ports on the appliance were configured to use active/backup mode or LACP mode.

The values shown in the table assume all four links are used.

b. Review the Network Communication section.

The Receive and Transmit tables show how many bytes and packets have been received and sent across each network as well as other receive and transmission metrics.

5. Select Storage to view information about the disk devices and volumes on the services appliance.

1037 View the Network tab

The Network tab displays a graph showing the network traffic received and sent across all of the network interfaces on the node, site, or grid.

The Network tab is shown for all nodes, each site, and the entire grid.

To display a different time interval, select one of the controls above the chart or graph. You can display the information available for intervals of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. You can also set a custom interval, which allows you to specify date and time ranges.

For nodes, the Network interfaces table provides information about each node’s physical network ports. The Network communications table provides details about each node’s receive and transmit operations and any driver reported fault counters.

View the Storage tab

The Storage tab summarizes storage availability and other storage metrics.

The Storage tab is shown for all nodes, each site, and the entire grid.

Storage used graphs

For Storage Nodes, each site, and the entire grid, the Storage tab includes graphs showing how much storage has been used by object data and object metadata over time.

1039

When a node is not connected to the grid, such as during upgrade or a disconnected state, certain metrics might be unavailable or excluded from site and grid totals. After a node reconnects to the grid, wait several minutes for the values to stabilize. Disk devices, Volumes, and Object stores tables

For all nodes, the Storage tab contains details for the disk devices and volumes on the node. For Storage Nodes, the Object Stores table provides information about each storage volume.

View the ILM tab

The ILM tab provides information about information lifecycle management (ILM) operations.

The ILM tab is shown for each Storage Node, each site, and the entire grid. For each site and the grid, the ILM tab shows a graph of the ILM queue over time. For the grid, this tab also provides the estimated time to complete a full ILM scan of all objects.

For Storage Nodes, the ILM tab provides details about ILM evaluation and background verification for erasure- coded objects.
