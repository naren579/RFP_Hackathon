Overview of the installation REST API StorageGRID provides the StorageGRID Installation API for performing installation tasks.

The API uses the Swagger open source API platform to provide the API documentation. Swagger allows both developers and non-developers to interact with the API in a user interface that illustrates how the API responds to parameters and options. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with standard web technologies and the JSON data format.

Any API operations you perform using the API Docs webpage are live operations. Be careful not to create, update, or delete configuration data or other data by mistake.

Each REST API command includes the API’s URL, an HTTP action, any required or optional URL parameters, and an expected API response. StorageGRID Installation API

The StorageGRID Installation API is only available when you are initially configuring your StorageGRID system, and if you need to perform a primary Admin Node recovery. The Installation API can be accessed over HTTPS from the Grid Manager.

To access the API documentation, go to the installation web page on the primary Admin Node and select Help > API documentation from the menu bar.

The StorageGRID Installation API includes the following sections:

config — Operations related to the product release and versions of the API. You can list the product release version and the major versions of the API supported by that release.

grid — Grid-level configuration operations. You can get and update grid settings, including grid details, Grid Network subnets, grid passwords, and NTP and DNS server IP addresses. nodes — Node-level configuration operations. You can retrieve a list of grid nodes, delete a grid node, configure a grid node, view a grid node, and reset a grid node’s configuration.

provision — Provisioning operations. You can start the provisioning operation and view the status of the provisioning operation.

recovery — Primary Admin Node recovery operations. You can reset information, upload the Recover Package, start the recovery, and view the status of the recovery operation.

recovery-package — Operations to download the Recovery Package. • schemas — API schemas for advanced deployments • sites — Site-level configuration operations. You can create, view, delete, and modify a site.

Where to go next

After completing an installation, perform the required integration and configuration tasks. You can perform the optional tasks as needed.

Required tasks

Create a tenant account for each client protocol (Swift or S3) that will be used to store objects on your StorageGRID system. 133

• Control system access by configuring groups and user accounts. Optionally, you can configure a federated

identity source (such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP), so you can import administration groups and users. Or, you can create local groups and users.

Integrate and test the S3 API or Swift API client applications you will use to upload objects to your StorageGRID system.

Configure the information lifecycle management (ILM) rules and ILM policy you want to use to protect object data.

If your installation includes appliance Storage Nodes, use SANtricity OS to complete the following tasks:

Connect to each StorageGRID appliance. ◦ Verify receipt of AutoSupport data. See Set up hardware.

Review and follow the StorageGRID system hardening guidelines to eliminate security risks.

Configure email notifications for system alerts.

If your StorageGRID system includes any Archive Nodes (deprecated), configure the Archive Node’s connection to the target external archival storage system. Optional tasks Where to go next
