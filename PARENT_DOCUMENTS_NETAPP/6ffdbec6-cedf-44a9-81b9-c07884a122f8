                       <b>Title:</b> When a service is stopped gracefully, this message is generated to indicate the shutdown
was requested. Typically this message is sent only after a subsequent restart, because
the audit message queue is not cleared before shutdown. Look for the SYST message,
sent at the beginning of the shutdown sequence, if the service has not restarted.<br>
