To change units for the storage values displayed in the Grid Manager, select the user drop-down in the upper right of the Grid Manager, then select User preferences. Your dashboard might be different based on system configuration.

View the dashboard

The dashboard consists of tabs that contain specific information about the StorageGRID system. Each tab contains categories of information displayed on cards.

You can use the system-provided dashboard as is. Additionally, you can create custom dashboards that contain only the tabs and cards that are relevant to monitoring your implementation of StorageGRID.

The system-provided dashboard tabs contain cards with the following types of information: Tab on system-provided dashboard
