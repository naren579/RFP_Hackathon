The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system. You can use the configure-storagegrid.py Python script and the configure-storagegrid.json configuration file to automate the configuration of your StorageGRID system.

You can also configure the system using the Grid Manager or the Installation API.

Steps

1. Log in to the Linux machine you are using to run the Python script.

2. Change to the directory where you extracted the installation archive. For example:

cd StorageGRID-Webscale-version/platform

where platform is debs, rpms, or vsphere.

3. Run the Python script and use the configuration file you created.

For example:

./configure-storagegrid.py ./configure-storagegrid.json --start-install

Result

A Recovery Package .zip file is generated during the configuration process, and it is downloaded to the directory where you are running the installation and configuration process. You must back up the Recovery Package file so that you can recover the StorageGRID system if one or more grid nodes fails. For example, copy it to a secure, backed up network location and to a secure cloud storage location.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

If you specified that random passwords be generated, open the Passwords.txt file and look for the passwords required to access your StorageGRID system. ###################################################################### ##### The StorageGRID "recovery package" has been downloaded as: ##### ##### ./sgws-recovery-package-994078-rev1.zip ##### ##### Safeguard this file as it will be needed in case of a ##### ##### StorageGRID node recovery. ##### ######################################################################

Your StorageGRID system is installed and configured when a confirmation message is displayed.

Deploy virtual grid nodes (Red Hat)

Create node configuration files for Red Hat Enterprise Linux deployments

Node configuration files are small text files that provide the information the StorageGRID host service needs to start a node and connect it to the appropriate network and block storage resources. Node configuration files are used for virtual nodes and aren’t used for appliance nodes. Location for node configuration files

Place the configuration file for each StorageGRID node in the /etc/storagegrid/nodes directory on the host where the node will run. For example, if you plan to run one Admin Node, one Gateway Node, and one Storage Node on HostA, you must place three node configuration files in /etc/storagegrid/nodes on HostA.

You can create the configuration files directly on each host using a text editor, such as vim or nano, or you can create them elsewhere and move them to each host. Naming of node configuration files

The names of the configuration files are significant. The format is node-name.conf, where node-name is a name you assign to the node. This name appears in the StorageGRID Installer and is used for node maintenance operations, such as node migration.

Node names must follow these rules:

Must be unique

Must start with a letter

Can contain the characters A through Z and a through z

Can contain the numbers 0 through 9

Can contain one or more hyphens (-)

Must be no more than 32 characters, not including the .conf extension

Any files in /etc/storagegrid/nodes that don’t follow these naming conventions will not be parsed by the host service.

If you have a multi-site topology planned for your grid, a typical node naming scheme might be: site-nodetype-nodenumber.conf

For example, you might use dc1-adm1.conf for the first Admin Node in Data Center 1, and dc2-sn3.conf for the third Storage Node in Data Center 2. However, you can use any scheme you like, as long as all node names follow the naming rules.

Contents of a node configuration file

A configuration file contains key/value pairs, with one key and one value per line. For each key/value pair, follow these rules:

The key and the value must be separated by an equal sign (=) and optional whitespace.

99

• The keys can contain no spaces.

The values can contain embedded spaces.

Any leading or trailing whitespace is ignored.

The following table defines the values for all supported keys. Each key has one of the following designations: Can contain the characters A through Z and a through z

Can contain the numbers 0 through 9

Can contain one or more hyphens (-)

Must be no more than 32 characters, not including the .conf extension

Any files in /etc/storagegrid/nodes that don’t follow these naming conventions will not be parsed by the host service.
