For FabricPool buckets, the recommended bucket consistency is Read-after-new-write, which is the default consistency for a new bucket. Don’t edit FabricPool buckets to use Available or Strong-site.

FabricPool tiering

If a StorageGRID node uses storage assigned from a NetApp ONTAP system, confirm that the volume does not have a FabricPool tiering policy enabled. For example, if a StorageGRID node is running on a VMware host, ensure the volume backing the datastore for the StorageGRID node does not have a FabricPool tiering policy enabled. Disabling FabricPool tiering for volumes used with StorageGRID nodes simplifies troubleshooting and storage operations.

Never use FabricPool to tier any data related to StorageGRID back to StorageGRID itself. Tiering StorageGRID data back to StorageGRID increases troubleshooting and operational complexity. Remove FabricPool data from StorageGRID

If you need to remove the FabricPool data that is currently stored in StorageGRID, you must use ONTAP to retrieve all data for the FabricPool volume and promote it to the performance tier.

Before you begin

You have reviewed the instructions and considerations in Promote data to the performance tier.

• You are using ONTAP 9.8 or later.

You are using a supported web browser.

You belong to a StorageGRID user group for the FabricPool tenant account that has the Manage all buckets or Root access permission. About this task

These instructions explain how to move data from StorageGRID back to FabricPool. You perform this procedure using ONTAP and StorageGRID Tenant Manager.

Steps

1. From ONTAP, issue the volume modify command.

Set tiering-policy to none to stop new tiering and set cloud-retrieval-policy to promote to return all data that was previously tiered to StorageGRID.

See Promote all data from a FabricPool volume to the performance tier.

2. Wait for the operation to complete.

You can use the volume object-store command with the tiering option to check the status of the performance tier promotion.

3. When the promote operation is complete, sign in to StorageGRID Tenant Manager for the FabricPool tenant account.

4. Select View buckets from the dashboard, or select STORAGE (S3) > Buckets.

5. Confirm that the FabricPool bucket is now empty.

6. If the bucket is empty, delete the bucket.

After you finish When you delete the bucket, tiering from FabricPool to StorageGRID can no longer continue. However, because the local tier is still attached to the StorageGRID cloud tier, ONTAP System Manager will return error messages indicating that the bucket is inaccessible.

To prevent these error messages, do either of the following:

Use FabricPool Mirror to attach a different cloud tier to the aggregate. Steps

Move the data from the FabricPool aggregate to a non-FabricPool aggregate and then delete the unused aggregate.

See the ONTAP documentation for FabricPool for instructions.

Use StorageGRID tenants and clients

Use a tenant account

Use a tenant account: Overview

A tenant account allows you to use either the Simple Storage Service (S3) REST API or the Swift REST API to store and retrieve objects in a StorageGRID system.

What is a tenant account?

Each tenant account has its own federated or local groups, users, S3 buckets or Swift containers, and objects. Tenant accounts can be used to segregate stored objects by different entities. For example, multiple tenant accounts can be used for either of these use cases:

Enterprise use case: If the StorageGRID system is being used within an enterprise, the grid’s object storage might be segregated by the different departments in the organization. For example, there might be tenant accounts for the Marketing department, the Customer Support department, the Human Resources department, and so on.
