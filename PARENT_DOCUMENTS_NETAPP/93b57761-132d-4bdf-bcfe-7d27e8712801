If you need to remove Storage Nodes before or after performing an expansion, you should not decommission more than 10 Storage Nodes in a single Decommission Node procedure. Guidelines for ADC service on Storage Nodes

When configuring the expansion, you must choose whether to include the Administrative Domain Controller (ADC) service on each new Storage Node. The ADC service keeps track of the location and availability of grid

services.

The StorageGRID system requires a quorum of ADC services to be available at each site and at all times.

At least three Storage Nodes at each site must include the ADC service.

Adding the ADC service to every Storage Node is not recommended. Including too many ADC services can cause slowdowns due to the increased amount of communication between nodes. You must examine your current ILM rules to determine where and when to add Storage Nodes to increase the storage available for replicated objects or erasure-coded objects.

You should not add more than 10 Storage Nodes in a single expansion procedure.

You can add Storage Nodes to more than one site in a single expansion procedure.

You can add Storage Nodes and other types of nodes in a single expansion procedure.

Before starting the expansion procedure, you must confirm that all data-repair operations performed as part of a recovery are complete. See Check data repair jobs.

A single grid should not have more than 48 Storage Nodes with the ADC service. This is equivalent to 16 sites with three ADC services at each site. In general, when you select the ADC Service setting for a new node, you should select Automatic. Select Yes only if the new node will replace another Storage Node that includes the ADC service. Because you can’t decommission a Storage Node if too few ADC services would remain, this ensures that a new ADC service is available before the old service is removed.

You can’t add the ADC service to a node after it is deployed. Add storage capacity for replicated objects

If the information lifecycle management (ILM) policy for your deployment includes a rule that creates replicated copies of objects, you must consider how much storage to add and where to add the new storage volumes or Storage Nodes.

For guidance on where to add additional storage, examine the ILM rules that create replicated copies. If ILM rules create two or more object copies, plan to add storage in each location where object copies are made. As a simple example, if you have a two-site grid and an ILM rule that creates one object copy at each site, you must add storage to each site to increase the overall object capacity of the grid. For information about object replication, see What is replication.

For performance reasons, you should attempt to keep storage capacity and compute power balanced across sites. So, for this example, you should add the same number of Storage Nodes to each site or additional storage volumes at each site. If you have a more complex ILM policy that includes rules that place objects in different locations based on criteria such as bucket name, or rules that change object locations over time, your analysis of where storage is required for the expansion will be similar, but more complex.

Charting how quickly overall storage capacity is being consumed can help you understand how much storage to add in the expansion, and when the additional storage space will be required. You can use the Grid Manager to monitor and chart storage capacity.

When planning the timing of an expansion, remember to consider how long it might take to procure and install additional storage. Add storage capacity for erasure-coded objects

If your ILM policy includes a rule that makes erasure-coded copies, you must plan where to add new storage and when to add new storage. The amount of storage you add and the timing of the addition can affect the grid’s usable storage capacity.
