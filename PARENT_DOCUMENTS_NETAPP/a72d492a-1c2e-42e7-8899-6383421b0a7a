Delete empty buckets

Use the S3 Console to manage bucket objects

If a grid administrator has enabled the use of platform services for the tenant account, an S3 tenant user with the appropriate permissions can also perform these tasks:

Configure S3 event notifications, which can be sent to a destination service that supports the Amazon Simple Notification Service.

Configure CloudMirror replication, which enables the tenant to automatically replicate objects to an external S3 bucket. Configure search integration, which sends object metadata to a destination search index whenever an object is created, deleted, or its metadata or tags are updated.

Platform services endpoints

If a grid administrator has enabled the use of platform services for the tenant account, an S3 tenant user with the Manage endpoints permission can configure a destination endpoint for each platform service. Grid federation connections

If a grid administrator has enabled the use of a grid federation connection for the tenant account, an S3 tenant user who has Root access permission can view the connection name, access the bucket details page for each bucket that has cross-grid replication enabled, and view the most recent error to occur when bucket data was being replicated to the other grid in the connection. See View grid federation connections. Access Management menu

The Access Management menu allows StorageGRID tenants to import user groups from a federated identity source and assign management permissions. Tenants can also manage local tenant groups and users, unless single sign-on (SSO) is in effect for the entire StorageGRID system.

Networking guidelines Networking guidelines: Overview

Use these guidelines to learn about StorageGRID architecture and networking topologies and to learn the requirements for network configuration and provisioning. About these instructions

These guidelines provide information you can use to create the StorageGRID networking infrastructure before deploying and configuring StorageGRID nodes. Use these guidelines to help ensure that communication can

occur among all the nodes in the grid and between the grid and external clients and services.

External clients and external services need to connect to StorageGRID networks to perform functions such as the following:

Store and retrieve object data

Receive email notifications

Access the StorageGRID management interface (the Grid Manager and Tenant Manager)

Access the audit share (optional)

Provide services such as:

Network Time Protocol (NTP) ◦ Domain name system (DNS) ◦ Key Management Server (KMS) The Access Management menu allows StorageGRID tenants to import user groups from a federated identity source and assign management permissions. Tenants can also manage local tenant groups and users, unless single sign-on (SSO) is in effect for the entire StorageGRID system.

StorageGRID networking must be configured appropriately to handle the traffic for these functions and more.

Before you begin Configuring the networking for a StorageGRID system requires a high level of experience with Ethernet switching, TCP/IP networking, subnets, network routing, and firewalls.

Before you configure networking, become familiar with StorageGRID architecture as described in Learn about StorageGRID.

After you determine which StorageGRID networks you want to use and how those networks will be configured, you can install and configure the StorageGRID nodes by following the appropriate instructions. Install appliance nodes

Install appliance hardware

Install software-based nodes

Install StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Install StorageGRID on Ubuntu or Debian

Install StorageGRID on VMware

Configure and administer StorageGRID software

Administer StorageGRID
