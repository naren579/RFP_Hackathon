Considerations for using an external syslog server

An external syslog server is a server outside of StorageGRID you can use to collect system audit information in a single location. Using an external syslog server enables you to reduce network traffic on your Admin Nodes and manage the information more efficiently. For StorageGRID, the outbound syslog message packet format is compliant with RFC 3164.

The types of audit information you can send to the external syslog server include:

Audit logs containing the audit messages generated during normal system operation

Security-related events such as logins and escalations to root

• Application logs that might be requested if it is necessary to open a support case to troubleshoot an issue

you have encountered

When to use an external syslog server An external syslog server is especially useful if you have a large grid, use multiple types of S3 applications, or want to retain all audit data. Sending audit information to an external syslog server enables you to:

Collect and manage audit information such as audit messages, application logs, and security events more efficiently.

Reduce network traffic on your Admin Nodes because audit information is transferred directly from the various Storage Nodes to the external syslog server, without having to go through an Admin Node.

When logs are sent to an external syslog server, single logs greater than 8,192 bytes are truncated at the end of the message to conform with common limitations in external syslog server implementations.

To maximize the options for full data recovery in the event of a failure of the external syslog server, up to 20 GB of local logs of audit records (localaudit.log) are maintained on each node.

If you plan to configure use the TLS or RELP/TLS protocol, you must have the following certificates: 1182
