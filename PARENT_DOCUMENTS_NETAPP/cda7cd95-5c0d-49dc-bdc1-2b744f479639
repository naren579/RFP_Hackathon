6. Enter the provisioning passphrase for your StorageGRID system in the Provisioning Passphrase text box.

7. Select Collect Logs.

When you submit a new request, the previous collection of log files is deleted.

You can use the Logs page to monitor the progress of log file collection for each grid node. If you receive an error message about log size, try collecting logs for a shorter time period or for fewer nodes.

8. Select Download when log file collection is complete.

The .tar.gz file contains all log files from all grid nodes where log collection was successful. Inside the combined .tar.gz file, there is one log file archive for each grid node.

After you finish

You can re-download the log file archive package later if you need to.

Optionally, you can select Delete to remove the log file archive package and free up disk space. The current log file archive package is automatically removed the next time you collect log files. Manually trigger an AutoSupport package

To assist technical support in troubleshooting issues with your StorageGRID system, you can manually trigger an AutoSupport package to be sent.

Before you begin

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You must have the Root access or Other grid configuration permission. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > AutoSupport.

2. On the Actions tab, select Send User-Triggered AutoSupport.

StorageGRID attempts to send an AutoSupport package to the NetApp Support Site. If the attempt is successful, the Most Recent Result and Last Successful Time values on the Results tab are updated. If there is a problem, the Most Recent Result value updates to "Failed," and StorageGRID does not try to send the AutoSupport package again.

After sending an User-triggered AutoSupport package, refresh the AutoSupport page in your browser after 1 minute to access the most recent results. View the Grid Topology tree

The Grid Topology tree provides access to detailed information about StorageGRID system elements, including sites, grid nodes, services, and components. In most cases, you only need to access the Grid Topology tree when instructed in the documentation or when working with technical support.

To access the Grid Topology tree, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

To expand or collapse the Grid Topology tree, click collapse all items in the entire site or in each node, hold down the <Ctrl> key and click. or

StorageGRID attributes

Attributes report values and statuses for many of the functions of the StorageGRID system. Attribute values are available for each grid node, each site, and the entire grid.

StorageGRID attributes are used in several places in the Grid Manager:

Nodes page: Many of the values shown on the Nodes page are StorageGRID attributes. (Prometheus

Events: System events occur when certain attributes record an error or fault condition for a node, including errors such as network errors. Attribute values

Attributes are reported on a best-effort basis and are approximately correct. Attribute updates can be lost under some circumstances, such as the crash of a service or the failure and rebuild of a grid node.
