If the object is not found, you can reset the count of Objects lost to clear the alert. The lack of an object indicates that the object was intentionally deleted. Locations > 0

If there are locations listed in the output, the Objects lost alert might be a false positive.

Confirm that the objects exist. Use the Node ID and filepath listed in the output to confirm that the object file is in the listed location.

(The procedure for searching for potentially lost objects explains how to use the Node ID to find the correct Storage Node.)

If the objects exist, you can reset the count of Objects lost to clear the alert. Locations = 0

If there are no locations listed in the output, the object is potentially missing. You can try to search for and restore the object yourself, or you can contact technical support.

Technical support might ask you to determine if there is a storage recovery procedure in progress. See the information about restoring object data using Grid Manager and restoring object data to a storage volume.

Search for and restore potentially lost objects

It might be possible to find and restore objects that have triggered a Lost Objects (LOST) alarm and a Object lost alert and that you have identified as potentially lost.

Before you begin

You have the UUID of any lost object, as identified in Investigate lost objects.

You have the Passwords.txt file. About this task

You can follow this procedure to look for replicated copies of the lost object elsewhere in the grid. In most cases, the lost object will not be found. However, in some cases, you might be able to find and restore a lost replicated object if you take prompt action.

Contact technical support for assistance with this procedure. Steps

1. From an Admin Node, search the audit logs for possible object locations:

a. Log in to the grid node:

i. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

1266

ii. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

iii. Enter the following command to switch to root: su - Technical support might ask you to determine if there is a storage recovery procedure in progress. See the information about restoring object data using Grid Manager and restoring object data to a storage volume.

iv. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

b. Change to the directory where the audit logs are located: cd /var/local/log/

c. Use grep to extract the audit messages associated with the potentially lost object and send them to an output file. Enter: grep uuid-valueaudit_file_name > output_file_name

For example:

Admin: # grep 926026C4-00A4-449B-AC72-BCCA72DD1311 audit.log > messages_about_lost_object.txt

d. Use grep to extract the Location Lost (LLST) audit messages from this output file. Enter: grep LLST

output_file_name For example:

Admin: # grep LLST messages_about_lost_objects.txt

An LLST audit message looks like this example message.

[AUDT:\[NOID\(UI32\):12448208\][CBIL(UI64):0x38186FE53E3C49A5] [UUID(CSTR):"926026C4-00A4-449B-AC72-BCCA72DD1311"][LTYP(FC32):CLDI] [PCLD\(CSTR\):"/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%\#3tN6"\] [TSRC(FC32):SYST][RSLT(FC32):NONE][AVER(UI32):10][ATIM(UI64): 1581535134379225][ATYP(FC32):LLST][ANID(UI32):12448208][AMID(FC32):CL SM] [ATID(UI64):7086871083190743409]]

e. Find the PCLD field and the NOID field in the LLST message.

If present, the value of PCLD is the complete path on disk to the missing replicated object copy. The value of NOID is the node id of the LDR where a copy of the object might be found.

If you find an object location, you might be able to restore the object.

f. Find the Storage Node associated with this LDR node ID. In the Grid Manager, select SUPPORT >

Tools > Grid topology. Then select Data Center > Storage Node > LDR. The Node ID for the LDR service is in the Node Information table. Review the information for each Storage Node until you find the one that hosts this LDR.
