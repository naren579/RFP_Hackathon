Note: The maximum recommended size for a single PutObject operation is 5 GiB (5,368,709,120 bytes). If you have objects that are larger than 5 GiB, use multipart upload instead. Bucket versioning and version IDs

If the source S3 bucket in StorageGRID has versioning enabled, you should also enable versioning for the destination bucket.

When using versioning, note that the ordering of object versions in the destination bucket is best effort and not guaranteed by the CloudMirror service, due to limitations in the S3 protocol.

Note: Version IDs for the source bucket in StorageGRID aren’t related to the version IDs for the destination bucket.

Tagging for object versions

The CloudMirror service does not replicate any PutObjectTagging or DeleteObjectTagging requests that supply a version ID, due to limitations in the S3 protocol. Because version IDs for the source and destination aren’t related, there is no way to ensure that a tag update to a specific version ID will be replicated. In contrast, the CloudMirror service does replicate PutObjectTagging requests or DeleteObjectTagging requests that don’t specify a version ID. These requests update the tags for the latest key (or the latest version if the bucket is versioned). Normal ingests with tags (not tagging updates) are also replicated. Multipart uploads and ETag values

When mirroring objects that were uploaded using a multipart upload, the CloudMirror service does not preserve the parts. As a result, the ETag value for the mirrored object will be different than the ETag value of the original object.

Objects encrypted with SSE-C (server-side encryption with customer- provided keys)

The CloudMirror service does not support objects that are encrypted with SSE-C. If you attempt to ingest an object into the source bucket for CloudMirror replication and the request includes the SSE-C request headers, the operation fails. Bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled

If the destination S3 bucket for CloudMirror replication has S3 Object Lock enabled, the attempt to configure bucket replication (PutBucketReplication) will fail with an AccessDenied error. Configure platform services endpoints

Before you can configure a platform service for a bucket, you must configure at least one

endpoint to be the destination for the platform service.

Access to platform services is enabled on a per-tenant basis by a StorageGRID administrator. To create or use a platform services endpoint, you must be a tenant user with Manage endpoints or Root access permission, in a grid whose networking has been configured to allow Storage Nodes to access external endpoint resources. For a single tenant, you can configure a maximum of 500 platform services endpoints. Contact your StorageGRID administrator for more information.

What is a platform services endpoint?

When you create a platform services endpoint, you specify the information that StorageGRID needs to access the external destination. For example, if you want to replicate objects from a StorageGRID bucket to an Amazon S3 bucket, you create a platform services endpoint that includes the information and credentials StorageGRID needs to access the destination bucket on Amazon.

Each type of platform service requires its own endpoint, so you must configure at least one endpoint for each platform service you plan to use. After defining a platform services endpoint, you use the endpoint’s URN as the destination in the configuration XML used to enable the service. You can use the same endpoint as the destination for more than one source bucket. For example, you could configure several source buckets to send object metadata to the same search integration endpoint so that you can perform searches across multiple buckets. You can also configure a source bucket to use more than one endpoint as a target, which enables you to do things like send notifications about object creation to one Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and notifications about object deletion to a second Amazon SNS topic.
