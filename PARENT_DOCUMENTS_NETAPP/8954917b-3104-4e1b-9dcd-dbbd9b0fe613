If quota usage alerts have been enabled in the Grid Manager, they will appear in the Tenant Manager when the quota is low or exceeded, as follows:

If 90% or more of a tenant’s quota has been used, the Tenant quota usage high alert is triggered. Perform the recommended actions for the alert.

If you exceed your quota, you can’t upload new objects. Endpoint errors

Understand Tenant Management API

You can perform system management tasks using the Tenant Management REST API instead of the Tenant Manager user interface. For example, you might want to use the API to automate operations or to create multiple entities, such as users, more quickly. The Tenant Management API:

Uses the Swagger open source API platform. Swagger provides an intuitive user interface that allows developers and non-developers to interact with the API. The Swagger user interface provides complete details and documentation for each API operation.

Uses versioning to support non-disruptive upgrades. To access the Swagger documentation for the Tenant Management API:

1. Sign in to the Tenant Manager.

2. From the top of the Tenant Manager, select the help icon and select API documentation. API operations

The Tenant Management API organizes the available API operations into the following sections:

764

• account: Operations on the current tenant account, including getting storage usage information.

auth: Operations to perform user session authentication. If you have used the Grid Manager to configure one or more endpoints for use with platform services, the Tenant Manager dashboard displays an alert if any endpoint errors have occurred within the past seven days.

auth: Operations to perform user session authentication.

The Tenant Management API supports the Bearer Token Authentication Scheme. For a tenant login, you provide a username, password, and accountId in the JSON body of the authentication request (that is, POST /api/v3/authorize). If the user is successfully authenticated, a security token is returned. This token must be provided in the header of subsequent API requests ("Authorization: Bearer token").

For information about improving authentication security, see Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery.

If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for the StorageGRID system, you must perform different steps to authenticate. See the instructions for using the Grid Management API. config: Operations related to the product release and versions of the Tenant Management API. You can list the product release version and the major versions of the API supported by that release.

containers: Operations on S3 buckets or Swift containers.

deactivated-features: Operations to view features that might have been deactivated.
