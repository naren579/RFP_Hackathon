7. Select Continue.

Step 3 (Upload client certificates) of the Edit a Key Management Server wizard appears.

8. If you need to replace the client certificate and the client certificate private key, select Browse and upload the new files.

9. Select Test and save. The connections between the key management server and all node-encrypted appliance nodes at the affected sites are tested. If all node connections are valid and the correct key is found on the KMS, the key management server is added to the table on the Key Management Server page.

10. If an error message appears, review the message details, and select OK.

443

For example, you might receive a 422: Unprocessable Entity error if the site you selected for this KMS is already managed by another KMS, or if a connection test failed.

11. If you need to save the current configuration before resolving the connection errors, select Force save.

Selecting Force save saves the KMS configuration, but it does not test the external connection from each appliance to that KMS. If there is an issue with the configuration, you might not be able to reboot appliance nodes that have node encryption enabled at the affected site. You might lose access to your data until the issues are resolved. The KMS configuration is saved.

12. Review the confirmation warning, and select OK if you are sure you want to force save the configuration.

The KMS configuration is saved, but the connection to the KMS is not tested.

Remove a key management server (KMS)

You might want to remove a key management server in some cases. For example, you might want to remove a site-specific KMS if you have decommissioned the site.

Before you begin

You have reviewed the considerations and requirements for using a key management server.

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Root access permission. About this task

You can remove a KMS in these cases:

You can remove a site-specific KMS if the site has been decommissioned or if the site includes no appliance nodes with node encryption enabled.

You can remove the default KMS if a site-specific KMS already exists for each site that has appliance nodes with node encryption enabled. Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Security > Key management server.

The Key management server page appears and shows all key management servers that have been configured.

2. Select the KMS you want to remove, and select Actions > Remove.

You can also remove a KMS by selecting the KMS name in the table and selecting Remove from the KMS details page.

3. Confirm the following is true:

You are removing a site-specific KMS for a site that has no appliance node with node encryption enabled.

You are removing the default KMS, but a site-specific KMS already exists for each site with node encryption. Before you begin

The KMS configuration is removed. Manage proxy settings

Configure storage proxy

If you are using platform services or Cloud Storage Pools, you can configure a non- transparent proxy between Storage Nodes and the external S3 endpoints. For example, you might need a non-transparent proxy to allow platform services messages to be sent to external endpoints, such as an endpoint on the internet.

Configured storage proxy settings do not apply to Kafka platform services endpoints.

Before you begin

You have specific access permissions.

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser. About this task
