storage URL

A client application can issue Swift REST API calls to perform supported account, container, and object operations against a Gateway Node or Storage Node. Storage requests are addressed to the storage URL returned in the authentication response. The request must also include the X-Auth-Token header and value returned from the auth request. https://FQDN | IP:Swift_Port/v1/Tenant_Account_ID

[/container][/object]

X-Auth-Token: token

999

Some storage response headers that contain usage statistics might not reflect accurate numbers for recently modified objects. It might take a few minutes for accurate numbers to appear in these headers.

The following response headers for account and container operations are examples of those that contain usage statistics:

X-Account-Bytes-Used

X-Account-Object-Count

X-Container-Bytes-Used

X-Container-Object-Count
