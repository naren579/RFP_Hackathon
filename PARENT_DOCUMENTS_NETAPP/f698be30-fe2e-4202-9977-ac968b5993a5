To use replication for site-loss protection, use the site-specific storage pools that are automatically created during StorageGRID installation. Then create ILM rules with placement instructions that specify multiple storage pools so that one copy of each object will be placed at each site.

To use erasure coding for site-loss protection, create storage pools that consist of multiple sites. Then create ILM rules that use one storage pool consisting of multiple sites and any available erasure-coding schema.

When configuring your StorageGRID deployment for site-loss protection, you must also take into account the effects of ingest options and consistency. Replication example

By default, one storage pool is created for each site during StorageGRID installation. Having storage pools that consist of only one site enables you to configure ILM rules that use replication for site-loss protection. In this example:

Storage pool 1 contains Site 1

Storage pool 2 contains Site 2

The ILM rule contains two placements:

Store objects by replicating 1 copy at Site 1 ◦ Store objects by replicating 1 copy at Site 2 ILM rule placements:

If one site is lost, copies of the objects are available at the other site.

Erasure coding example Replication and erasure coding require different storage pool configurations:

Erasure coding example

Having storage pools that consist of more than one site per storage pool enables you to configure ILM rules that use erasure coding for site-loss protection. In this example:

Storage pool 1 contains Sites 1 through 3

The ILM rule contains one placement: Store objects by erasure coding using a 4+2 EC scheme at Storage pool 1, which contains three sites ILM rule placements:

622

In this example:

The ILM rule uses a 4+2 erasure-coding scheme.

Each object is sliced into four equal data fragments, and two parity fragments are computed from the object data.

Each of the six fragments is stored on a different node across three data center sites to provide data protection for node failures or site loss.

Erasure coding is allowed in storage pools containing any number of sites except two sites.

ILM rule using 4+2 erasure-coding scheme:

If one site is lost, data can still be recovered:

Create a storage pool

You create storage pools to determine where the StorageGRID system stores object data and the type of storage used. Each storage pool includes one or more sites and one or more storage grades.

When you install StorageGRID 11.8 on a new grid, storage pools are automatically created for each site. However, if you initially installed StorageGRID 11.6 or earlier, storage pools aren’t automatically created for each site. If you want to create Cloud Storage Pools to store object data outside of your StorageGRID system, see the information about using Cloud Storage Pools.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

You have reviewed the guidelines for creating storage pools. About this task

Storage pools determine where object data is stored. The number of storage pools you need depends on the number of sites in your grid and on the types of copies you want: replicated or erasure-coded.

For replication and single-site erasure coding, create a storage pool for each site. For example, if you want to store replicated object copies at three sites, create three storage pools.

For erasure coding at three or more sites, create one storage pool that includes an entry for each site. For example, if you want to erasure code objects across three sites, create one storage pool.
