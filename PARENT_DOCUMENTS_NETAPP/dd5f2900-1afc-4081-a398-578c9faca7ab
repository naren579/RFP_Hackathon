5. In Grid Network, modify settings for the following properties as necessary:

IPv4 Address (CIDR): The CIDR network address for the Grid Network interface (eth0 inside the container). For example: 192.168.1.234/21

Gateway: The Grid Network gateway. For example: 192.168.0.1 The gateway is required if there are multiple grid subnets.

If you selected DHCP for the Grid Network configuration and you change the value here, the new value will be configured as a static address on the node. You must make sure the resulting IP address is not within a DHCP address pool.

6. If you want to configure the Admin Network for the grid node, add or update the settings in the Admin Network section as necessary.

Enter the destination subnets of the routes out of this interface in the Subnets (CIDR) text box. If there are multiple Admin subnets, the Admin gateway is required.

If you selected DHCP for the Admin Network configuration and you change the value here, the new value will be configured as a static address on the node. You must make sure the resulting IP address is not within a DHCP address pool. Appliances: For a StorageGRID appliance, if the Admin Network was not configured during the initial installation using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, it can’t be configured in this Grid Manager dialog box. Instead, you must follow these steps:

a. Reboot the appliance: In the Appliance Installer, select Advanced > Reboot.

Rebooting can take several minutes.

b. Select Configure Networking > Link Configuration and enable the appropriate networks.

c. Select Configure Networking > IP Configuration and configure the enabled networks. d. Return to the Home page and click Start Installation.

e. In the Grid Manager: If the node is listed in the Approved Nodes table, remove the node.

f. Remove the node from the Pending Nodes table.

g. Wait for the node to reappear in the Pending Nodes list.

h. Confirm that you can configure the appropriate networks. They should already be populated with the

information you provided on the IP Configuration page of the Appliance Installer.

For additional information, see the Quick start for hardware installation to locate instructions for your appliance.

7. If you want to configure the Client Network for the grid node, add or update the settings in the Client Network section as necessary. If the Client Network is configured, the gateway is required, and it becomes the default gateway for the node after installation. If you selected DHCP for the Client Network configuration and you change the value here, the new value will be configured as a static address on the node. You must make sure the resulting IP address is not within a DHCP address pool.

Appliances: For a StorageGRID appliance, if the Client Network was not configured during the initial installation using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, it can’t be configured in this Grid Manager dialog box.
