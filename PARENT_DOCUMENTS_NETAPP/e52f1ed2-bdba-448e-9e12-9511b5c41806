Address any errors or warnings before proceeding to the next step.

7. Run the following command to restart the node without port remaps: sudo storagegrid node start node-name

8. Log in to the node as admin using the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

9. Verify that the services start correctly.

a. View a list of the statuses of all services on the server:sudo storagegrid-status

The status is updated automatically.

b. Wait until all services have a status of either Running or Verified.

c. Exit the status screen:Ctrl+C

10. Repeat these steps on each Admin Node and Gateway Node that has conflicting remapped ports. Network procedures

Update subnets for Grid Network

StorageGRID maintains a list of the network subnets used to communicate between grid nodes on the Grid Network (eth0). These entries include the subnets used for the Grid Network by each site in your StorageGRID system as well as any subnets used for NTP, DNS, LDAP, or other external servers accessed through the Grid Network gateway. When you add grid nodes or a new site in an expansion, you might need to update or add subnets to the Grid Network.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.

You have the provisioning passphrase.

You have the network addresses, in CIDR notation, of the subnets you want to configure. About this task

If you are performing an expansion activity that includes adding a new subnet, you must add a new subnet to the Grid Network subnet list before you start the expansion procedure. Otherwise, you will have to cancel the expansion, add the new subnet, and start the expansion again.

Add a subnet Steps

1. Select MAINTENANCE > Network > Grid Network.

2. Select Add another subnet to add a new subnet in CIDR notation.

For example, enter 10.96.104.0/22.

3. Enter the provisioning passphrase, and select Save.

4. Wait until the changes are applied, then download a new Recovery Package.

1511

a. Select MAINTENANCE > System > Recovery package. b. Enter the Provisioning Passphrase.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system. It is also used to recover the primary Admin Node.

The subnets you have specified are configured automatically for your StorageGRID system. Edit a subnet

Steps

1. Select MAINTENANCE > Network > Grid Network.

2. Select the subnet you want to edit and make the necessary changes.

3. Enter the Provisioning passphrase, and select Save.

4. Select Yes in the confirmation dialog box.

5. Wait until the changes are applied, then download a new Recovery Package. a. Select MAINTENANCE > System > Recovery package.

b. Enter the Provisioning Passphrase.

Delete a subnet

Steps

1. Select MAINTENANCE > Network > Grid Network.

2. Select the delete icon

next to the subnet.

3. Enter the Provisioning passphrase, and select Save.

4. Select Yes in the confirmation dialog box.

5. Wait until the changes are applied, then download a new Recovery Package. a. Select MAINTENANCE > System > Recovery package.

b. Enter the Provisioning Passphrase.

Configure IP addresses Configure IP addresses: Overview

You can perform network configuration by configuring IP addresses for grid nodes using the Change IP tool.

You must use the Change IP tool to make most changes to the networking configuration that was initially set during grid deployment. Manual changes using standard Linux networking commands and files might not propagate to all StorageGRID services, and might not persist across upgrades, reboots, or node recovery procedures.
