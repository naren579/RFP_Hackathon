Because the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the list of legacy alarms on the Current Alarms page is increased whenever a new alarm occurs. You can typically ignore the alarms (because alerts provide a better view of the system), or you can acknowledge the alarms.

Optionally, when you have completely transitioned to the alert system, you can disable each legacy alarm to prevent it from being triggered and added to the count of legacy alarms.
