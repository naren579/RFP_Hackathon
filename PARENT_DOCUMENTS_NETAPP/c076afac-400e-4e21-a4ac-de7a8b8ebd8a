      <td>Configures StorageGRID CloudMirror replication for the bucket using the\nreplication configuration XML provided in the request body. For CloudMirror\nreplication, you should be aware of the following implementation details:\n• StorageGRID only supports V1 of the replication configuration. This means\nthat StorageGRID does not support the use of the element for rules, Filter\nand follows V1 conventions for deletion of object versions. For details, see\nAmazon Simple Storage Service User Guide: Replication configuration.\n• Bucket replication can be configured on versioned or unversioned buckets.\n• You can specify a different destination bucket in each rule of the replication\nconfiguration XML. A source bucket can replicate to more than one\ndestination bucket.\n• Destination buckets must be specified as the URN of StorageGRID endpoints\nas specified in the Tenant Manager or the Tenant Management API. See\nConfigure CloudMirror replication.\nThe endpoint must exist for replication configuration to succeed. If the\nendpoint does not exist, the request fails as a The error 400 Bad Request.\nmessage states: Unable to save the replication policy. The\nspecified endpoint URN does not exist: URN.\n• You don’t need to specify a in the configuration XML. This value is not Role\nused by StorageGRID and will be ignored if submitted.\n• If you omit the storage class from the configuration XML, StorageGRID uses\nthe storage class by default. STANDARD\n• If you delete an object from the source bucket or you delete the source bucket\nitself, the cross-region replication behavior is as follows:\n◦If you delete the object or bucket before it has been replicated, the\nobject/bucket is not replicated and you aren’t notified.\n◦If you delete the object or bucket after it has been replicated,\nStorageGRID follows standard Amazon S3 delete behavior for V1 of\ncross-region replication.</td>
