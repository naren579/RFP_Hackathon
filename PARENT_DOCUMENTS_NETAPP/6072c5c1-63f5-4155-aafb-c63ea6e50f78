The audit message contains information about the bucket owner’s tenant account so that you can track these anonymous and cross-account requests.

In the following example message, the client sends a GetObject request for an object stored in a bucket that they don’t own. The values for SBAI and SBAC record the bucket owner’s tenant account ID and name, which differs from the tenant account ID and name of the client recorded in S3AI and SACC.
