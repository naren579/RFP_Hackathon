Automate the configuration of StorageGRID

After deploying the grid nodes, you can automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You know the location of the following files from the installation archive. Filename

Description

configure-storagegrid.py

Python script used to automate the configuration

configure-storagegrid.sample.json

Example configuration file for use with the script

222

Filename

Description

configure-storagegrid.blank.json

Blank configuration file for use with the script

You have created a configure-storagegrid.json configuration file. To create this file, you can modify the example configuration file (configure-storagegrid.sample.json) or the blank configuration file (configure-storagegrid.blank.json).

You can use the configure-storagegrid.py Python script and the configure-storagegrid.json configuration file to automate the configuration of your StorageGRID system.

You can also configure the system using the Grid Manager or the Installation API. Steps

1. Log in to the Linux machine you are using to run the Python script.

2. Change to the directory where you extracted the installation archive.

For example:

cd StorageGRID-Webscale-version/platform

where platform is debs, rpms, or vsphere.

3. Run the Python script and use the configuration file you created. For example:

./configure-storagegrid.py ./configure-storagegrid.json --start-install

Result

A Recovery Package .zip file is generated during the configuration process, and it is downloaded to the directory where you are running the installation and configuration process. You must back up the Recovery Package file so that you can recover the StorageGRID system if one or more grid nodes fails. For example, copy it to a secure, backed up network location and to a secure cloud storage location.

The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

If you specified that random passwords should be generated, open the Passwords.txt file and look for the passwords required to access your StorageGRID system.

Your StorageGRID system is installed and configured when a confirmation message is displayed.

StorageGRID has been configured and installed.

Collect information about your deployment environment

Before deploying grid nodes, you must collect information about your network configuration and VMware environment.

It is more efficient to perform one single installation of all the nodes, rather than installing some nodes now and some nodes later. VMware information

You must access the deployment environment and collect information about the VMware environment; the networks that were created for the Grid, Admin, and Client Networks; and the storage volume types you plan to use for Storage Nodes.

You must collect information about your VMware environment, including the following:

The username and password for a VMware vSphere account that has appropriate permissions to complete the deployment.

Host, datastore, and network configuration information for each StorageGRID node virtual machine.

VMware live vMotion causes the virtual machine clock time to jump and is not supported for grid nodes of any type. Though rare, incorrect clock times can result in loss of data or configuration updates. Grid Network information

You must collect information about the VMware network created for the StorageGRID Grid Network (required), including:

224

â€¢ The network name.

The method used to assign IP addresses, either static or DHCP. StorageGRID has been configured and installed.
