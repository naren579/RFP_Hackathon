Add grid nodes to add capabilities to your system You can add redundancy or additional capabilities to a StorageGRID system by adding new grid nodes to existing sites.

For example, you might choose to add Gateway Nodes to use in a high availability (HA) group, or you might add an Admin Node at a remote site to permit monitoring using a local node.

You can add one or more of the following types of nodes to one or more existing sites in a single expansion operation:

Non-primary Admin Nodes

Storage Nodes

Gateway Nodes

When preparing to add grid nodes, be aware of the following limitations:

The primary Admin Node is deployed during the initial installation. You can’t add a primary Admin Node

during an expansion.

You can add Storage Nodes and other types of nodes in the same expansion.

When adding Storage Nodes, you must carefully plan the number and location of the new nodes. See Guidelines for adding object capacity. If the Set new node default option is Untrusted on the Untrusted Client Networks tab on the Firewall control page, client applications that connect to expansion nodes using the Client Network must connect using a load balancer endpoint port (CONFIGURATION > Security > Firewall control). See the instructions to change the security setting for the new node and to configure load balancer endpoints.

Add a new site

You can expand your StorageGRID system by adding a new site.

Guidelines for adding a site

Before adding a site, review the following requirements and limitations:

You can only add one site per expansion operation.

You can’t add grid nodes to an existing site as part of the same expansion.

All sites must include at least three Storage Nodes.

Adding a new site does not automatically increase the number of objects you can store. The total object capacity of a grid depends on the amount of available storage, the ILM policy, and the metadata capacity at each site. When sizing a new site, you must ensure that it includes enough metadata capacity.

StorageGRID keeps a copy of all object metadata at every site. When you add a new site, you must ensure that it includes enough metadata capacity for the existing object metadata and enough metadata capacity for growth.

You must consider the available network bandwidth between sites, and the level of network latency. Metadata updates are continually replicated between sites even if all objects are stored only at the site where they are ingested.

Because your StorageGRID system remains operational during the expansion, you must review ILM rules before starting the expansion procedure. You must ensure that object copies aren’t stored to the new site until the expansion procedure is complete. For example, before you begin the expansion, determine if any rules use the default storage pool (All Storage Nodes). If they do, you must create a new storage pool that contains the existing Storage Nodes and update your ILM rules to use the new storage pool. Otherwise, objects will be copied to the new site as soon as the first node at that site becomes active.

For more information about changing ILM when adding a new site, see the example for changing an ILM policy.

Gather required materials

Before performing an expansion operation, gather the materials and install and configure any new hardware and networks. Item

Notes

StorageGRID installation archive

If you are adding new grid nodes or a new site, you must download and extract the StorageGRID installation archive. You must use the same version that is currently running on the grid.

For details, see the instructions for downloading and extracting the StorageGRID installation files.

Note: You don’t need to download files if you are adding new storage volumes to existing Storage Nodes or installing a new StorageGRID appliance. Service laptop
