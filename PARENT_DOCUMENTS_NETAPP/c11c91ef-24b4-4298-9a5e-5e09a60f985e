The Buckets page appears and shows all existing S3 buckets.

2. Use the Actions menu or the details page for a specific bucket.

Actions menu

a. Select the checkbox for each bucket you want to delete.

b. Select Actions > Delete buckets. Details page

a. Select a bucket name to display its details.

b. Select Delete bucket.

3. When the confirmation dialog box appears, select Yes.

StorageGRID confirms that each bucket is empty and then deletes each bucket. This operation might take a few minutes.

If a bucket is not empty, an error message appears. You must delete all objects and any delete markers in the bucket before you can delete the bucket. Use S3 Console

You can use S3 Console to view and manage the objects in an S3 bucket.

S3 Console allows you to:

Upload, download, rename, copy, move, and delete objects

View, revert, download, and delete object versions

Search for objects by prefix

Manage object tags

View object metadata

View, create, rename, copy, move, and delete folders

S3 Console provides an improved user experience for the most common cases. It is not designed to replace CLI or API operations in all situations.

If using S3 Console results in operations taking too long (for example, minutes or hours), consider:

Reducing the number of selected objects

Using non-graphical (API or CLI) methods to access your data

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a supported web browser. If you want to manage objects, you belong to a user group that has the Root access permission. Alternatively, you belong to a user group that has the Use S3 Console tab permission and either the View all buckets permission or Manage all buckets permission. See Tenant management permissions.

You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a supported web browser. If you want to manage objects, you belong to a user group that has the Root access permission. Alternatively, you belong to a user group that has the Use S3 Console tab permission and either the View all buckets permission or Manage all buckets permission. See Tenant management permissions.

An S3 Group or Bucket policy has been configured for the user. See Use bucket and group access policies.

You know the user’s access key ID and secret access key. Optionally, you have a .csv file containing this information. See the instructions for creating access keys. Steps

1. Select STORAGE > Buckets > bucket name.

2. Select the S3 Console tab.

3. Paste the access key ID and secret access key into the fields. Otherwise, select Upload access keys and select your .csv file.

4. Select Sign in.

5. The table of bucket objects appears. You can manage objects as needed. Additional information

Search by prefix: The prefix search feature only searches for objects that begin with a specific word relative to the current folder. The search does not include objects that contain the word elsewhere. This rule also applies to objects within folders. For example, a search for folder1/folder2/somefile- would return objects that are within the folder1/folder2/ folder and begin with the word somefile-.

Drag and drop: You can drag and drop files from your computer’s file manager to S3 Console. However, you cannot upload folders.

Operations on folders: When you move, copy, or rename a folder, all objects in the folder are updated one at a time, which might take time.

Permanent deletion when bucket versioning is disabled: When you overwrite or delete an object in a bucket with versioning disabled, the operation is permanent. See Change object versioning for a bucket. Manage S3 platform services

Manage platform services: Overview

StorageGRID platform services can help you implement a hybrid cloud strategy by allowing you to send event notifications and copies of S3 objects and object metadata to external destinations.

If the use of platform services is allowed for your tenant account, you can configure the following services for any S3 bucket: CloudMirror replication
