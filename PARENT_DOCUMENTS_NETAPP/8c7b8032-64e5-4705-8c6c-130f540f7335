Description

Automatic discovery of all connected primary Admin Nodes

a. Select the Enable Admin Node discovery checkbox.

b. Wait for the list of discovered IP addresses to be displayed. c. Select the primary Admin Node for the grid where this appliance

Storage Node will be deployed.

d. Click Save.

e. Wait for the connection state for the new IP address to become ready.

4. In the Node name field, enter the name you want to use for this appliance node, and select Save.

The node name is assigned to this appliance node in the StorageGRID system. It is shown on the Nodes page (Overview tab) in the Grid Manager. If required, you can change the name when you approve the node.

5. In the Installation section, confirm that the current state is "Ready to start installation of node name into grid with primary Admin Node admin_ip" and that the Start Installation button is enabled.

If the Start Installation button is not enabled, you might need to change the network configuration or port settings. For instructions, see the maintenance instructions for your appliance.

6. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer home page, select Start Installation.

The Current state changes to "Installation is in progress," and the Monitor Installation page is displayed. 7. If your expansion includes multiple appliance nodes, repeat the previous steps for each appliance.

If you need to deploy multiple appliance Storage Nodes at one time, you can automate the installation process by using the configure-sga.py appliance installation script.

8. If you need to manually access the Monitor Installation page, select Monitor Installation from the menu bar.

The Monitor Installation page shows the installation progress.

1415

The blue status bar indicates which task is currently in progress. Green status bars indicate tasks that have completed successfully.

The installer ensures that tasks completed in a previous install aren’t re-run. If you are re- running an installation, any tasks that don’t need to be re-run are shown with a green status bar and a status of "Skipped."

9. Review the progress of first two installation stages.

1. Configure appliance During this stage, one of the following processes occurs:

For a storage appliance, the installer connects to the storage controller, clears any existing configuration, communicates with SANtricity OS to configure volumes, and configures host settings. ◦ For a services appliance, the installer clears any existing configuration from the drives in the compute

controller, and configures host settings.

2. Install OS

During this stage, the installer copies the base operating system image for StorageGRID to the appliance.

10. Continue monitoring the installation progress until a message appears in the console window, prompting you to use the Grid Manager to approve the node.

Wait until all nodes you added in this expansion are ready for approval before going to the Grid Manager to approve the nodes.

1416 Perform expansion

When you perform the expansion, the new grid nodes are added to your existing StorageGRID deployment.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the provisioning passphrase.

You have deployed all of the grid nodes that are being added in this expansion.

You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
