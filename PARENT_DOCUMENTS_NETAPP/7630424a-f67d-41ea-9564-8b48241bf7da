1. Select Test connection.

2. If you did not provide a bind username format:

A "Test connection successful" message appears if the connection settings are valid. Select Save to save the configuration.

A "test connection could not be established" message appears if the connection settings are invalid. Select Close. Then, resolve any issues and test the connection again.

3. If you provided a bind username format, enter the username and password of a valid federated user.

For example, enter your own username and password. Don’t include any special characters in the username, such as @ or /.

A "Test connection successful" message appears if the connection settings are valid. Select Save to save the configuration.

An error message appears if the connection settings, bind username format, or test username and password are invalid. Resolve any issues and test the connection again. Force synchronization with identity source

The StorageGRID system periodically synchronizes federated groups and users from the identity source. You can force synchronization to start if you want to enable or restrict user permissions as quickly as possible.

Steps

1. Go to the Identity federation page.

2. Select Sync server at the top of the page.

The synchronization process might take some time depending on your environment.

The Identity federation synchronization failure alert is triggered if there is an issue synchronizing federated groups and users from the identity source. Disable identity federation

You can temporarily or permanently disable identity federation for groups and users. When identity federation is disabled, there is no communication between StorageGRID and the identity source. However, any settings you have configured are retained, allowing you to easily reenable identity federation in the future. About this task

Before you disable identity federation, you should be aware of the following:

Federated users will be unable to sign in.

786

• Federated users who are currently signed in will retain access to the StorageGRID system until their

session expires, but they will be unable to sign in after their session expires.

Synchronization between the StorageGRID system and the identity source will not occur, and alerts or alarms will not be raised for accounts that have not been synchronized.

The Enable identity federation checkbox is disabled if single sign-on (SSO) is set to Enabled or Sandbox Mode. The SSO Status on the Single Sign-on page must be Disabled before you can disable identity federation. See Disable single sign-on. Steps

1. Go to the Identity federation page.

2. Uncheck the Enable identity federation checkbox.

Guidelines for configuring OpenLDAP server

If you want to use an OpenLDAP server for identity federation, you must configure specific settings on the OpenLDAP server.

For identity sources that aren’t ActiveDirectory or Azure, StorageGRID will not automatically block S3 access to users who are disabled externally. To block S3 access, delete any S3 keys for the user or remove the user from all groups. Memberof and refint overlays Before you disable identity federation, you should be aware of the following:

The memberof and refint overlays should be enabled. For more information, see the instructions for reverse group membership maintenance in the OpenLDAP documentation: Version 2.4 Administrator’s Guide.

Indexing

You must configure the following OpenLDAP attributes with the specified index keywords:

olcDbIndex: objectClass eq

olcDbIndex: uid eq,pres,sub

olcDbIndex: cn eq,pres,sub

olcDbIndex: entryUUID eq

In addition, ensure the fields mentioned in the help for Username are indexed for optimal performance.
