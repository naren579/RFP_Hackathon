RSLT

Result

Returns successful (SUCS) or the error reported by the backend.

OLST: System Detected Lost Object

This message is generated when the DDS service can’t locate any copies of an object within the StorageGRID system.

1359

Code

Field

Description CBID

Content Block Identifier

The CBID of the lost object.

NOID

Node ID

If available, the last known direct or near-line location of the lost object. It is possible to have just the Node ID without a Volume ID if the volume information is not available.

PATH

S3 Bucket/Key or Swift Container/Object ID

If available, the S3 bucket name and S3 key name, or the Swift container name and Swift object identifier. RSLT

Result

This field has the value NONE. RSLT is a mandatory message field, but is not relevant for this message. NONE is used rather than SUCS so that this message is not filtered.

UUID

Universally Unique ID

The identifier of the lost object within the StorageGRID system.

VOLI

Volume ID

If available, the Volume ID of the Storage Node or Archive Node for the last known location of the lost object. ORLM: Object Rules Met

This message is generated when the object is successfully stored and copied as specified by the ILM rules.

The ORLM message is not generated when an object is successfully stored by the default Make 2 Copies rule if another rule in the policy uses the Object Size advanced filter. Code

Field

Description

BUID

Bucket Header

Bucket ID field. Used for internal operations. Appears only if STAT is PRGD.

CBID

Content Block Identifier

The CBID of the object.

CSIZ

Content size

The size of the object in bytes.

1360

Code

Field

Description

LOCS

Locations

The storage location of object data within the StorageGRID system. The value for LOCS is "" if the object has no locations (for example, it has been deleted).

CLEC: for erasure-coded objects, the erasure-coding profile ID and the erasure coding group ID that is applied to the object’s data.

CLDI: for replicated objects, the LDR node ID and the volume ID of the object’s location.

CLNL: ARC node ID of the object’s location if the object data is archived. PATH

S3 Bucket/Key or Swift Container/Object ID

The S3 bucket name and S3 key name, or the Swift container name and Swift object identifier.

RSLT

Result

The result of the ILM operation.

SUCS: The ILM operation was successful.

RULE

Rules Label

The human-readable label given to the ILM rule applied to this object. SEGC

Container UUID UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only if the object is segmented.

SGCB

Container CBID CBID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only for segmented and multipart objects.

STAT

Status

The status of ILM operation.

DONE: ILM operations against the object have completed.

DFER: The object has been marked for future ILM re-evaluation.

PRGD: The object has been deleted from the StorageGRID system.

NLOC: The object data can no longer be found in the StorageGRID system. This status might indicate that all copies of object data are missing or damaged. UUID

Universally Unique Identifier

The identifier of the object within the StorageGRID system.

VSID

Version ID

The version ID of a new object created in a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets and objects in unversioned buckets don’t include this field.

The ORLM audit message can be issued more than once for a single object. For instance, it is issued

1361

whenever one of the following events occur:

ILM rules for the object are satisfied forever. Container UUID UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only if the object is segmented.

SGCB

Container CBID CBID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only for segmented and multipart objects.

STAT

Status

The status of ILM operation.

DONE: ILM operations against the object have completed.

DFER: The object has been marked for future ILM re-evaluation.

PRGD: The object has been deleted from the StorageGRID system.

NLOC: The object data can no longer be found in the StorageGRID system. This status might indicate that all copies of object data are missing or damaged. UUID

Universally Unique Identifier

The identifier of the object within the StorageGRID system.

VSID

Version ID

The version ID of a new object created in a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets and objects in unversioned buckets don’t include this field.

The ORLM audit message can be issued more than once for a single object. For instance, it is issued

1361

whenever one of the following events occur:

ILM rules for the object are satisfied forever.

ILM rules for the object are satisfied for this epoch.

ILM rules have deleted the object.

The background verification process detects that a copy of replicated object data is corrupt. The StorageGRID system performs an ILM evaluation to replace the corrupt object.
