The source object version was not found.

The source bucket was not found.

The destination bucket was deleted.

The destination bucket was re-created by a different account.

The destination bucket has versioning suspended.

The destination bucket was re-created by the same account but is now unversioned.

Recommended actions

If an error message appears in the Last error column, follow these steps:

1. Review the message text.

2. Perform any recommended actions. For example, if versioning was suspended on the destination bucket for cross-grid replication, reenable versioning for that bucket. 3. Select the connection or tenant account from the table.

4. Select Clear error.

5. Select Yes to clear the message and update the system’s status.

6. Wait 5-6 minutes and then ingest a new object into the bucket. Confirm that the error message does not

reappear.

To ensure the error message is cleared, wait at least 5 minutes after the timestamp in the message before ingesting a new object.

After you clear the error, a new Last error might appear if objects are ingested in a different bucket that also has an error.

7. To determine if any objects failed to be replicated because of the bucket error, see Identify and retry failed replication operations. Cross-grid replication permanent failure alert

Issue

The Cross-grid replication permanent failure alert was triggered.

Details

This alert indicates that tenant objects can’t be replicated between the buckets on two grids for a reason that requires user intervention to resolve. This alert is typically caused by a change to either the source or the destination bucket.

Recommended actions

1. Sign in to the grid where the alert was triggered.

2. Go to CONFIGURATION > System > Grid federation, and locate the connection name listed in the alert.

3. On the Permitted tenants tab, look at the Last error column to determine which tenant accounts have errors.

4. To learn more about the failure, see the instructions in Monitor grid federation connections to review the cross-grid replication metrics.

5. For each affected tenant account:

a. See the instructions in Monitor tenant activity to confirm that the tenant has not exceeded its quota on the destination grid for cross-grid replication.

b. As required, increase the tenant’s quota on the destination grid to allow new objects to be saved.

6. For each affected tenant, sign in to Tenant Manager on both grids, so you can compare the list of buckets.

7. For each bucket that has cross-grid replication enabled, confirm the following: Issue

6. For each affected tenant, sign in to Tenant Manager on both grids, so you can compare the list of buckets.

7. For each bucket that has cross-grid replication enabled, confirm the following:

There is a corresponding bucket for the same tenant on the other grid (must use the exact name). ◦ Both buckets have object versioning enabled (versioning can’t be suspended on either grid). ◦ Both buckets have S3 Object Lock disabled. ◦ Neither bucket is in the Deleting objects: read-only state.

8. To confirm that the issue was resolved, see the instructions in Monitor grid federation connections to review the cross-grid replication metrics, or perform these steps:

a. Go back to the Grid federation page.

b. Select the affected tenant, and select Clear Error in the Last error column. c. Select Yes to clear the message and update the system’s status.

To ensure the error message is cleared, wait at least 5 minutes after the timestamp in the message before ingesting a new object.

It might take up to a day for the alert to clear after it is resolved.
