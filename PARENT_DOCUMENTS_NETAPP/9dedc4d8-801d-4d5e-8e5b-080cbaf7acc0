Manage Archive Nodes Archive to the cloud through the S3 API

You can configure an Archive Node to connect directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or to any other system that can interface to the StorageGRID system through the S3 API.

Support for Archive Nodes is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Moving objects from an Archive Node to an external archival storage system through the S3 API has been replaced by ILM Cloud Storage Pools, which offer more functionality.

The Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3) option is also deprecated. If you are currently using an Archive Node with this option, migrate your objects to a Cloud Storage Pool instead.

Additionally, you should remove Archive Nodes from the active ILM policy in StorageGRID 11.7 or earlier. Removing object data stored on Archive Nodes will simplify future upgrades. See Working with ILM rules and ILM policies. Configure connection settings for the S3 API

If you are connecting to an Archive Node using the S3 interface, you must configure the connection settings for the S3 API. Until these settings are configured, the ARC service remains in a Major alarm state as it is unable to communicate with the external archival storage system.

You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have specific access permissions.

You have created a bucket on the target archival storage system:

The bucket is dedicated to a single Archive Node. It can’t be used by other Archive Nodes or other applications.

The bucket has the appropriate region selected for your location. ◦ The bucket should be configured with versioning suspended.

Object Segmentation is enabled and the Maximum Segment Size is less than or equal to 4.5 GiB (4,831,838,208 bytes). S3 API requests that exceed this value will fail if S3 is used as the external archival storage system. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Target.

3. Select Configuration > Main.
