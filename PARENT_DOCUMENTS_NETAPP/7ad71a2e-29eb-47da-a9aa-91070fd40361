If\nall copies can’t be removed within 30 seconds (for example, because a\nlocation is temporarily unavailable), StorageGRID queues the copies for\nremoval and then indicates success to the client.\nVersioning\nTo remove a specific version, the requestor must be the bucket\nowner and use the subresource. Using this subresource versionId\npermanently deletes the version. If the corresponds to a versionId\ndelete marker, the response header is x-amz-delete-marker\nreturned set to true.\n• subresource on a If an object is deleted without the versionId\nversion enabled bucket, it results in the generation of a delete\nmarker. The for the delete marker is returned using versionId\nthe response header, and the x-amz-version-id x-amz-\nresponse header is returned set to delete-marker true.\n• If an object is deleted without the subresource on a versionId\nversion suspended bucket, it results in a permanent deletion of\nan already existing 'null' version or a 'null' delete marker, and the\ngeneration of a new 'null' delete marker.
