      <td>Uses the subresource to add a set of tags to an existing tagging\nobject.\nObject tag limits\nYou can add tags to new objects when you upload them, or you can\nadd them to existing objects. Both StorageGRID and Amazon S3\nsupport up to 10 tags for each object. Tags associated with an object\nmust have unique tag keys. A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode\ncharacters in length and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode\ncharacters in length. Key and values are case sensitive.\nTag updates and ingest behavior\nWhen you use PutObjectTagging to update an object’s tags,\nStorageGRID does not re-ingest the object. This means that the\noption for Ingest Behavior specified in the matching ILM rule is not\nused. Any changes to object placement that are triggered by the\nupdate are made when ILM is re-evaluated by normal background\nILM processes.\nThis means that if the ILM rule uses the Strict option for ingest\nbehavior, no action is taken if the required object placements can’t be\nmade (for example, because a newly required location is\nunavailable). The updated object retains its current placement until\nthe required placement is possible.\nResolving conflicts\nConflicting client requests, such as two clients writing to the same\nkey, are resolved on a "latest-wins" basis. The timing for the "latest-\nwins" evaluation is based on when the StorageGRID system\ncompletes a given request, and not on when S3 clients begin an\noperation.\nVersioning\nquery parameter is not specified in the request, the If the versionId\noperation add tags to the most recent version of the object in a\nversioned bucket. If the current version of the object is a delete\nmarker, a "MethodNotAllowed" status is returned with the x-amz-\nresponse header set to delete-marker true.</td>
