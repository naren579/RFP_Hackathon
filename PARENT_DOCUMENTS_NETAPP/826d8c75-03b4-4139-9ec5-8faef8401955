The Archive Node continues to accept object data for transfer to the TSM server after the TSM server stops accepting new content. This content can’t be written to media managed by the TSM server. An alarm is triggered if this happens.

Prevent ARC service from sending content to TSM server

To prevent the ARC service from sending further content to the TSM server, you can take the Archive Node

offline by taking its ARC > Store component offline. This procedure can also be useful in preventing alarms when the TSM server is unavailable for maintenance. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Store.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Change Store State to Offline.

5. Select Archive Store Disabled on Startup.

6. Select Apply Changes.

Set Archive Node to read-only if TSM middleware reaches capacity

If the targeted TSM middleware server reaches capacity, the Archive Node can be optimized to only perform retrievals. Steps

1. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology.

2. Select Archive Node > ARC > Target.

3. Select Configuration > Main.

4. Change Maximum Retrieve Sessions to be the same as the number of concurrent sessions listed in Number of Sessions.

5. Change Maximum Store Sessions to 0.

Changing Maximum Store Sessions to 0 is not necessary if the Archive Node is Read-only. Store sessions will not be created.

6. Select Apply Changes. Configure Archive Node retrieve settings

You can configure the retrieve settings for an Archive Node to set the state to Online or Offline, or reset the failure counts being tracked for the associated alarms.

4. Modify the following settings, as necessary:

Retrieve State: Set the component state to either:

▪ Online: The grid node is available to retrieve object data from the archival media device. ▪ Offline: The grid node is not available to retrieve object data.

Reset Request Failures Count: Select the checkbox to reset the counter for request failures. This can be used to clear the ARRF (Request Failures) alarm.

Reset Verification Failure Count: Select the checkbox to reset the counter for verification failures on retrieved object data. This can be used to clear the ARRV (Verification Failures) alarm.

5. Select Apply Changes. Configure Archive Node replication

You can configure the replication settings for an Archive Node and disable inbound and outbound replication, or reset the failure counts being tracked for the associated alarms.

Reset Inbound Replication Failure Count: Select to reset the counter for inbound replication failures. This can be used to clear the RIRF (Inbound Replications — Failed) alarm.

Reset Outbound Replication Failure Count: Select to reset the counter for outbound replication failures. This can be used to clear the RORF (Outbound Replications — Failed) alarm.

Disable Inbound Replication: Select to disable inbound replication as part of a maintenance or testing procedure. Leave cleared during normal operation. Reset Verification Failure Count: Select the checkbox to reset the counter for verification failures on retrieved object data. This can be used to clear the ARRV (Verification Failures) alarm.
