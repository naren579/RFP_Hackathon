      <td>The Administrative Domain Controller (ADC) service authenticates grid\nnodes and their connections with each other. The ADC service is hosted on\na minimum of three Storage Nodes at a site.\nThe ADC service maintains topology information including the location and\navailability of services. When a grid node requires information from another\ngrid node or an action to be performed by another grid node, it contacts an\nADC service to find the best grid node to process its request. In addition, the\nADC service retains a copy of the StorageGRID deployment’s configuration\nbundles, allowing any grid node to retrieve current configuration information.\nTo facilitate distributed and islanded operations, each ADC service\nsynchronizes certificates, configuration bundles, and information about\nservices and topology with the other ADC services in the StorageGRID\nsystem.\nIn general, all grid nodes maintain a connection to at least one ADC service.\nThis ensures that grid nodes are always accessing the latest information.\nWhen grid nodes connect, they cache other grid nodes' certificates, enabling\nsystems to continue functioning with known grid nodes even when an ADC\nservice is unavailable. New grid nodes can only establish connections by\nusing an ADC service.\nThe connection of each grid node lets the ADC service gather topology\ninformation. This grid node information includes the CPU load, available disk\nspace (if it has storage), supported services, and the grid node’s site ID.\nOther services ask the ADC service for topology information through\ntopology queries. The ADC service responds to each query with the latest\ninformation received from the StorageGRID system.</td>
