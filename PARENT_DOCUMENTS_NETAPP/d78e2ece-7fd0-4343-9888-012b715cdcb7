Steps

1. Log in to the primary Admin Node: a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@primary_Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

b. When prompted, press Enter.

The NFS configuration utility is displayed.

c. Close the NFS configuration utility: exit

8. Determine if you must enable audit shares at other sites.

If the StorageGRID deployment is a single site, go to the next step. ◦ If the StorageGRID deployment includes Admin Nodes at other sites, enable these audit shares as required:

a. Remotely log in to the site’s Admin Node: i. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

ii. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

iii. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

iv. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

b. Repeat these steps to configure the audit shares for each additional Admin Node.

c. Close the remote secure shell login to the remote Admin Node. Enter: exit

9. Log out of the command shell: exit
