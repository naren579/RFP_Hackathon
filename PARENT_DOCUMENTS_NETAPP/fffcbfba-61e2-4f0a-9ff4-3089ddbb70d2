The default consistency is set to guarantee read-after-write for newly created objects.

Before you begin

The x-ntap-sg-consistency parameter must contain one of the following values:

Provides eventual consistency for both new objects and object updates. For S3 buckets, use only as required (for example, for a bucket that contains log values that are rarely read, or for HEAD or GET operations on keys that don’t exist). Not supported for S3 FabricPool buckets.

Note: In general, you should use the "Read-after-new-write" consistency. If requests aren’t working correctly, change the application client behavior if possible. Or, configure the client to specify the consistency for each API request. Set the consistency at the bucket level only as a last resort. Request example

PUT /bucket?x-ntap-sg-consistency=strong-global HTTP/1.1 Date: date Authorization: authorization string Host: host
