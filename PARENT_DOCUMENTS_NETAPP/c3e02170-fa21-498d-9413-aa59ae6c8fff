The following table describes the information shown in the Grid Manager for current and resolved alerts. Column header

Description

Name or title

The name of the alert and its description. Severity

The severity of the alert. For current alerts, if multiple alerts are grouped the title row shows how many instances of that alert are occurring at each severity.

Critical: An abnormal condition exists that has stopped the normal

operations of a StorageGRID node or service. You must address the underlying issue immediately. Service disruption and loss of data might result if the issue is not resolved.

Major: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current operations

or approaching the threshold for a critical alert. You should investigate major alerts and address any underlying issues to ensure that the abnormal condition does not stop the normal operation of a StorageGRID node or service.

Minor: The system is operating normally, but an abnormal condition exists that could affect the system’s ability to operate if it continues. You should monitor and resolve minor alerts that don’t clear on their own to ensure they don’t result in a more serious problem. Time triggered Resolved alerts: You can search and view a history of alerts that have been resolved.

Resolved alerts: How long ago the alert was triggered. Site/Node

The name of the site and node where the alert is occurring or has occurred.

Column header

Description Current values or data values

The value of the metric that caused the alert to be triggered. For some alerts, additional values are shown to help you understand and investigate the alert. For example, the values shown for a Low object data storage alert include the percentage of disk space used, the total amount of disk space, and the amount of disk space used.

Note: If multiple current alerts are grouped, current values aren’t shown in the title row.

Triggered values (resolved alerts only)

The value of the metric that caused the alert to be triggered. For some alerts, additional values are shown to help you understand and investigate the alert. For example, the values shown for a Low object data storage alert include the percentage of disk space used, the total amount of disk space, and the amount of disk space used. Steps
