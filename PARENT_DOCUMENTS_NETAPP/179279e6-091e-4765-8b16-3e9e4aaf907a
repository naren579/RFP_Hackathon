External communications

External communications

Clients need to communicate with grid nodes to ingest and retrieve content. The ports used depends on the object storage protocols chosen. These ports need to be accessible to the client. Restricted access to ports

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of the ports, you can use load balancer endpoints to allow access on user-defined ports.

Port remapping

To use systems and protocols such as SMTP, DNS, SSH, or DHCP, you must remap ports when deploying nodes. However, you should not remap load balancer endpoints. For information about port remapping, see the installation instructions:

Install StorageGRID on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

64

â€¢ Install StorageGRID on Ubuntu or Debian

Install StorageGRID on VMware

Optional: Remap network ports for appliance

Ports used for external communications
