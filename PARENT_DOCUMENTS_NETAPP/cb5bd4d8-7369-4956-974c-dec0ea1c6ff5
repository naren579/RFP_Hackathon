Field

Description

Duration

How long you want this silence to remain in effect, in minutes, hours, or days. A silence can be in effect from 5 minutes to 1,825 days (5 years).

Note: You should not silence an alert rule for an extended amount of time. If an alert rule is silenced, you might not detect an underlying problem until it prevents a critical operation from completing. However, you might need to use an extended silence if an alert is triggered by a specific, intentional configuration, such as might be the case for the Services appliance link down alerts and the Storage appliance link down alerts. Severity

Which alert severity or severities should be silenced. If the alert is triggered at one of the selected severities, no notifications are sent.

Nodes

Which node or nodes you want this silence to apply to. You can suppress an alert rule or all rules on the entire grid, a single site, or a single node. If you select the entire grid, the silence applies to all sites and all nodes. If you select a site, the silence applies only to the nodes at that site.

Note: You can’t select more than one node or more than one site for each silence. You must create additional silences if you want to suppress the same alert rule on more than one node or more than one site at one time.
