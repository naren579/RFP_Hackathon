If you are downloading a CA bundle, all the certificates in the CA bundle secondary tabs download as a single file.

b. Specify the certificate file name and download location. Save the file with the extension .pem. For example: storagegrid_certificate.pem

Copy certificate or CA bundle PEM

Copy the certificate text to paste elsewhere. If you are using an optional CA bundle, each certificate in the bundle displays on its own sub-tab.

a. Select Copy certificate PEM or Copy CA bundle PEM.

If you are copying a CA bundle, all the certificates in the CA bundle secondary tabs copy together. b. Paste the copied certificate into a text editor.
