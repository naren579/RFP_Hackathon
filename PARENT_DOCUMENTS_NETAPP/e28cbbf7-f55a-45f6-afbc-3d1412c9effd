If these messages appear for more than an hour after you started the upgrade, something might have occurred that prevented the primary Admin Node from being upgraded. If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, contact technical support.

Web interface does not respond as expected

The Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager might not respond as expected after StorageGRID software is upgraded.

If you experience issues with the web interface:

Make sure you are using a supported web browser. Browser support typically changes for each StorageGRID release.

Clear your web browser cache.

Clearing the cache removes outdated resources used by the previous version of StorageGRID software, and permits the user interface to operate correctly again. For instructions, see the documentation for your web browser. "Docker image availability check" error messages

When attempting to start the upgrade process, you might receive an error message that states "The following issues were identified by the Docker image availability check validation suite." All issues must be resolved before you can complete the upgrade.

Contact technical support if you are unsure of the changes required to resolve the identified issues.

The RPM or DEB packages for the upgrade have not been installed on the host where the node is running, or the images are still in the process of being imported.

Note: This error only applies to nodes that are running as containers on Linux.

Check to make sure that the RPM or DEB packages have been installed on all Linux hosts where nodes are running. Make sure the version is correct for both the service and the images file. Wait a few minutes, and try again.
