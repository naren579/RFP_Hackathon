      <td>Cross-grid replication creates versioned\nobjects, and it replicates the version ID from\nthe source bucket to the destination bucket.\nThis allows the version order to be maintained\nacross both grids.</td>
      <td>CloudMirror replication doesn’t require\nversioning-enabled buckets, so CloudMirror\ncan only maintain ordering for a key within a\nsite. There are no guarantees that ordering\nwill be maintained for requests to an object at\ndifferent site.</td>

      <td>Applications can retrieve or read objects by\nmaking a request either to StorageGRID or to\nthe S3 destination. For example, suppose you\nuse CloudMirror replication to mirror objects\nto a partner organization. The partner can use\nits own applications to read or update objects\ndirectly from the S3 destination. Using\nStorageGRID is not required.</td>
