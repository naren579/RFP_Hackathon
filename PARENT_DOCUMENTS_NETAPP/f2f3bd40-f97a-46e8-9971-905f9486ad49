Code

Field

Description CBID

Content Block Identifier

The unique identifier of the content block which failed verification.

RSLT

Result Code

Verification failure type:

CRCF: Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) failed.

HMAC: Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) check failed.

EHSH: Unexpected encrypted content hash.

PHSH: Unexpected original content hash. SEQC: Incorrect data sequence on disk.

PERR: Invalid structure of disk file.

DERR: Disk error.

FNAM: Bad file name.

This message should be monitored closely. Content verification failures can indicate impending hardware failures.

To determine what operation triggered the message, see the value of the AMID (Module ID) field. For example, an SVFY value indicates that the message was generated by the Storage Verifier module, that is, background verification, and STOR indicates that the message was triggered by content retrieval. SVRU: Object Store Verify Unknown

The LDR service’s Storage component continuously scans all copies of replicated object data in the object store. This message is issued when an unknown or unexpected copy of replicated object data is detected in the object store and moved to the quarantine directory. Code

Field

Description

FPTH

File Path

The file path of the unexpected object copy.

RSLT

Result

This field has the value 'NONE'. RSLT is a mandatory message field, but is not relevant for this message. 'NONE' is used rather than 'SUCS' so that this message is not filtered.

The SVRU: Object Store Verify Unknown audit message should be monitored closely. It means unexpected copies of object data were detected in the object store. This situation should be investigated immediately to determine how theses copies were created, because it can indicate impending hardware failures.

SYSD: Node Stop

When a service is stopped gracefully, this message is generated to indicate the shutdown was requested. Typically this message is sent only after a subsequent restart, because the audit message queue is not cleared before shutdown. Look for the SYST message, sent at the beginning of the shutdown sequence, if the service has not restarted. Code

Field

Description

RSLT

Clean Shutdown The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shutdown. The LDR service’s Storage component continuously scans all copies of replicated object data in the object store. This message is issued when an unknown or unexpected copy of replicated object data is detected in the object store and moved to the quarantine directory. Code

Field

Description

FPTH

File Path

The file path of the unexpected object copy.

Field

Description

RSLT

Clean Shutdown The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shutdown.

The message does not indicate if the host server is being stopped, only the reporting service. The RSLT of a SYSD can’t indicate a "dirty" shutdown, because the message is generated only by "clean" shutdowns. SYST: Node Stopping

When a service is gracefully stopped, this message is generated to indicate the shutdown was requested and that the service has initiated its shutdown sequence. SYST can be used to determine if the shutdown was requested, before the service is restarted (unlike SYSD, which is typically sent after the service restarts.) Code

Field

Description

RSLT

Clean Shutdown The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shutdown.

The message does not indicate if the host server is being stopped, only the reporting service. The RSLT code of a SYST message can’t indicate a "dirty" shutdown, because the message is generated only by "clean" shutdowns. SYSU: Node Start

When a service is restarted, this message is generated to indicate if the previous shutdown was clean (commanded) or disorderly (unexpected).

Code

Field

Description

RSLT

Clean Shutdown The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shut down.

DSDN: System was not cleanly shut down.

VRGN: System was started for the first time after server installation (or re-installation).
