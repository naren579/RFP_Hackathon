If you use the stage option, you must restart the node as soon as possible after staging to minimize disruptions. This validation ensures that the rules for the Grid, Admin, and Client Networks, such as not using overlapping subnets, aren’t violated.

In this example, validation returned errors.

In this example, validation passed. 1516

8. After validation passes, choose one of the following options:

8: Save unapplied changes.

This option allows you to quit the Change IP tool and start it again later, without losing any unapplied changes.

10: Apply the new network configuration.

9. If you selected option 10, choose one of the following options:

apply: Apply the changes immediately and automatically restart each node if necessary.

If the new network configuration does not require any physical networking changes, you can select apply to apply the changes immediately. Nodes will be restarted automatically, if necessary. Nodes that need to be restarted will be displayed.

stage: Apply the changes the next time the nodes are restarted manually. If you need to make physical or virtual networking configuration changes for the new network configuration to function, you must use the stage option, shut down the affected nodes, make the necessary physical networking changes, and restart the affected nodes. If you select apply without first making these networking changes, the changes will usually fail.

If you use the stage option, you must restart the node as soon as possible after staging to minimize disruptions.

cancel: Don’t make any network changes at this time.

If you were unaware that the proposed changes require nodes to be restarted, you can defer the changes to minimize user impact. Selecting cancel returns you to the main menu and preserves your changes so you can apply them later.

When you select apply or stage, a new network configuration file is generated, provisioning is performed, and nodes are updated with new working information.

During provisioning, the output displays the status as updates are applied. Generating new grid networking description file...

Updating grid network configuration on Name

After you apply or stage changes, a new Recovery Package is generated as a result of the grid configuration change.

10. If you selected stage, follow these steps after provisioning is complete:

a. Make the physical or virtual networking changes that are required.

Physical networking changes: Make the necessary physical networking changes, safely shutting down the node if necessary.

Linux: If you are adding the node to an Admin Network or Client Network for the first time, ensure that you have added the interface as described in Linux: Add interfaces to existing node.

b. Restart the affected nodes.

11. Select 0 to exit the Change IP tool after your changes are complete.

12. Download a new Recovery Package from the Grid Manager. a. Select MAINTENANCE > System > Recovery package.

b. Enter the provisioning passphrase.

Add to or change subnet lists on Admin Network

You can add, delete, or change the subnets in the Admin Network Subnet List of one or more nodes.

Before you begin

You have the Passwords.txt file.

You can add, delete, or change subnets to all nodes on the Admin Network Subnet List. Steps

1. Log in to the primary Admin Node:

a. Enter the following command: ssh admin@primary_Admin_Node_IP

b. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

c. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

d. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #.

2. Start the Change IP tool by entering the following command: change-ip

3. Enter the provisioning passphrase at the prompt.

The main menu appears.

4. Optionally, limit the networks/nodes on which operations are performed. Choose one of the following:

Select the nodes to edit by choosing 1, if you want to filter on specific nodes on which to perform the operation. Select one of the following options:

▪ 1: Single node (select by name) ▪ 2: Single node (select by site, then by name) ▪ 3: Single node (select by current IP) ▪ 4: All nodes at a site ▪ 5: All nodes in the grid ▪ 0: Go back You have the Passwords.txt file.

You can add, delete, or change subnets to all nodes on the Admin Network Subnet List. Steps
