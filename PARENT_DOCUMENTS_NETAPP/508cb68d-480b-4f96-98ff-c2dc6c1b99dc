Monitor system health

Monitor the overall health of your StorageGRID system on a daily basis.

About this task

The StorageGRID system can continue to operate when parts of the grid are unavailable. Potential issues indicated by alerts or alarms (legacy system) aren’t necessarily issues with system operations. Investigate

Description

Action required Not connected - Unknown

Requires immediate attention. Select each alert and follow the recommended actions.

For an unknown reason, a node is disconnected or services on the node are unexpectedly down. For example, a service on the node might be stopped, or the node might have lost its network connection because of a power failure or unexpected outage.

For example, you might need to restart a service that has stopped or restart the host for the node.

Note: A node might appear as Unknown during managed shutdown operations. You can ignore the Unknown state in these cases.

The Unable to communicate with node alert might also be triggered. Other alerts might also be active.

Not connected - Administratively down

Determine if any alerts are affecting this node.

For an expected reason, node is not connected to grid.

If one or more alerts are active, select each alert and follow the recommended actions. For example, the node, or services on the node, has been gracefully shut down, the node is rebooting, or the software is being upgraded. One or more alerts might also be active.

Based on the underlying issue, these nodes often go back online with no intervention.

Connected

No action required.

The node is connected to the grid.

View current and resolved alerts

Current alerts: When an alert is triggered, an alert icon is displayed on the dashboard. An alert icon is also displayed for the node on the Nodes page. If alert email notifications are configured, an email notification will also be sent, unless the alert has been silenced.
