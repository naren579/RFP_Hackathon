b. Change the number of CPUs or the amount of memory as required.

Set the Memory Reservation to the same size as the Memory allocated to the virtual machine. c. Select OK.

13. Power on the virtual machine.

After you finish

If you deployed this node as part of an expansion or recovery procedure, return to those instructions to complete the procedure.

Configure the grid and complete installation (VMware)

Navigate to the Grid Manager

You use the Grid Manager to define all of the information required to configure your StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

The primary Admin Node must be deployed and have completed the initial startup sequence. Steps

1. Open your web browser and navigate to one of the following addresses:

https://primary_admin_node_ip

https://client_network_ip

Alternatively, you can access the Grid Manager on port 8443:

https://primary_admin_node_ip:8443

232

You can use the IP address for the primary Admin Node IP on the Grid Network or on the Admin Network, as appropriate for your network configuration. You might need to use the security/advanced option in your browser to navigate to an untrusted certificate.

2. Select Install a StorageGRID system.

The page used to configure a StorageGRID grid appears.

Specify the StorageGRID license information

You must specify the name for your StorageGRID system and upload the license file provided by NetApp. Steps

1. On the License page, enter a meaningful name for your StorageGRID system in the Grid Name field.

After installation, the name is displayed at the top of the Nodes menu.

2. Select Browse, locate the NetApp license file (NLF-unique-id.txt), and select Open.

The license file is validated, and the serial number is displayed.

The StorageGRID installation archive includes a free license that does not provide any support entitlement for the product. You can update to a license that offers support after installation.

233

3. Select Next. Add sites

You must create at least one site when you are installing StorageGRID. You can create additional sites to increase the reliability and storage capacity of your StorageGRID system.

Steps

1. On the Sites page, enter the Site Name.

2. To add additional sites, click the plus sign next to the last site entry and enter the name in the new Site Name text box.

Add as many additional sites as required for your grid topology. You can add up to 16 sites.

3. Click Next.

Specify Grid Network subnets

You must specify the subnets that are used on the Grid Network. About this task

The subnet entries include the subnets for the Grid Network for each site in your StorageGRID system, along with any subnets that need to be reachable through the Grid Network. After installation, the name is displayed at the top of the Nodes menu.

2. Select Browse, locate the NetApp license file (NLF-unique-id.txt), and select Open.

The license file is validated, and the serial number is displayed.

The StorageGRID installation archive includes a free license that does not provide any support entitlement for the product. You can update to a license that offers support after installation.

Specify Grid Network subnets

You must specify the subnets that are used on the Grid Network. About this task

The subnet entries include the subnets for the Grid Network for each site in your StorageGRID system, along with any subnets that need to be reachable through the Grid Network.

If you have multiple grid subnets, the Grid Network gateway is required. All grid subnets specified must be reachable through this gateway. Steps

1. Specify the CIDR network address for at least one Grid Network in the Subnet 1 text box.

2. Click the plus sign next to the last entry to add an additional network entry.

If you have already deployed at least one node, click Discover Grid Networks Subnets to automatically populate the Grid Network Subnet List with the subnets reported by grid nodes that have registered with the Grid Manager.

3. Click Next.

Approve pending grid nodes

You must approve each grid node before it can join the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You have deployed all virtual and StorageGRID appliance grid nodes.

It is more efficient to perform one single installation of all the nodes, rather than installing some nodes now and some nodes later. Steps

1. Review the Pending Nodes list, and confirm that it shows all of the grid nodes you deployed.
