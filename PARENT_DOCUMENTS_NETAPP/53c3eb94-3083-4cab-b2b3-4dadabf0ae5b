Use single sign-on (SSO)

Configure single sign-on

When single sign-on (SSO) is enabled, users can only access the Grid Manager, the Tenant Manager, the Grid Management API, or the Tenant Management API if their credentials are authorized using the SSO sign-in process implemented by your organization. Local users can’t sign in to StorageGRID. How single sign-on works

The StorageGRID system supports single sign-on (SSO) using the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) standard.

Before enabling single sign-on (SSO), review how the StorageGRID sign-in and sign-out processes are affected when SSO is enabled.

Sign in when SSO is enabled

When SSO is enabled and you sign in to StorageGRID, you are redirected to your organization’s SSO page to validate your credentials. Steps

1. Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of any StorageGRID Admin Node in a web browser.

The StorageGRID Sign in page appears.

If this is the first time you have accessed the URL on this browser, you are prompted for an account ID:

The StorageGRID Sign in page is not shown when you enter the complete URL for a tenant account (that is, a fully qualified domain name or IP address followed by /?accountId=20-digit-account-id). Instead, you are immediately redirected to your organization’s SSO sign-in page, where you can sign in with your SSO credentials.

2. Indicate whether you want to access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager:

To access the Grid Manager, leave the Account ID field blank, enter 0 as the account ID, or select Grid Manager if it appears in the list of recent accounts. To access the Tenant Manager, enter the 20-digit tenant account ID or select a tenant by name if it appears in the list of recent accounts.
