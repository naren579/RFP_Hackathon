A Python script used to automate the configuration of a StorageGRID system.

./vsphere/configure-sga.py

A Python script used to automate the configuration of StorageGRID appliances. ./vsphere/storagegrid-ssoauth.py

An example Python script that you can use to sign in to the Grid Management API when single sign-on (SSO) is enabled. You can also use this script for Ping Federate.

./vsphere/configure- storagegrid.sample.json ./vsphere/vsphere-gateway.mf ./vsphere/vsphere-storage.ovf

The template file (.ovf) and manifest file (.mf) for deploying virtual machine-based Storage Nodes.

./vsphere/vsphere-storage.mf

Deployment scripting tool

Description

./vsphere/deploy-vsphere-ovftool.sh

A Bash shell script used to automate the deployment of virtual grid nodes.

./vsphere/configure-storagegrid.py

A Python script used to automate the configuration of a StorageGRID system.

./vsphere/configure-sga.py

A Python script used to automate the configuration of StorageGRID appliances. ./vsphere/storagegrid-ssoauth.py

./vsphere/configure- storagegrid.sample.json

An example configuration file for use with the configure-storagegrid.py script. ./vsphere/configure- storagegrid.blank.json

A blank configuration file for use with the configure-storagegrid.py script.

./vsphere/storagegrid-ssoauth-azure.py

An example Python script that you can use to sign in to the Grid Management API when single sign-on (SSO) is enabled using Active Directory or Ping Federate. ./vsphere/storagegrid-ssoauth-azure.js

A helper script called by the companion storagegrid-ssoauth-azure.py Python script to perform SSO interactions with Azure.

./vsphere/extras/api-schemas

API schemas for StorageGRID.

Note: Before you perform an upgrade, you can use these schemas to confirm that any code you have written to use StorageGRID management APIs will be compatible with the new StorageGRID release if you don’t have a non-production StorageGRID environment for upgrade compatibility testing.

11. If you are expanding a StorageGRID appliance-based system, select the appropriate files. Path and file name

Description

./debs/storagegrid-webscale-images- version-SHA.deb

DEB package for installing the StorageGRID node images on your appliances.

1401

Path and file name

Description

./debs/storagegrid-webscale-images- version-SHA.deb.md5

MD5 checksum for the file /debs/storagegridwebscale- images-version-SHA.deb.

For appliance installation, these files are only required if you need to avoid network traffic. The appliance can download the required files from the primary Admin Node. Verify hardware and networking

Before beginning the expansion of your StorageGRID system, ensure the following:

The hardware needed to support the new grid nodes or new site has been installed and configured.

All new nodes have bidirectional communication paths to all existing and new nodes (a requirement for the Grid Network). In particular, confirm that the following TCP ports are open between the new nodes you are adding in the expansion and the primary Admin Node:

1055 ◦ 7443 ◦ 8011 ◦ 10342 See Internal grid node communications.

The primary Admin Node can communicate with all expansion servers that are intended to host the StorageGRID system.

If any of the new nodes has a Grid Network IP address on a subnet not previously used, you have already added the new subnet to the Grid Network subnet list. Otherwise, you will have to cancel the expansion, add the new subnet, and start the procedure again. 1401
