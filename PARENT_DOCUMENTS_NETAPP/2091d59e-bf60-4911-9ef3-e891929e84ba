You can’t edit the All Storage Nodes storage pool (StorageGRID 11.6 and earlier).

3. Select Edit.

4. As required, change the storage pool name.

5. As required, select other sites and storage grades.

You are prevented from changing the site or storage grade if the storage pool is used in an erasure-coding profile and the change would cause the erasure-coding scheme to become invalid. For example, if a storage pool used in a erasure-coding profile currently includes a storage grade with only one site, you are prevented from using a storage grade with two sites because the change would make the erasure-coding scheme invalid.

6. Select Save.

After you finish If you added a new site or storage grade to a storage pool used in the active ILM policy, activate a new ILM policy to force StorageGRID to use the new site or storage grade. For example, clone your existing ILM policy and then activate the clone. See Work with ILM rules and ILM policies.

You can’t remove a storage pool if it is being used in an ILM rule or in an erasure-coding profile. As required, select storage pool name > ILM usage to determine where the storage pool is used.

3. If the storage pool you want to remove is not being used, select the checkbox.

5. Select OK. Use Cloud Storage Pools

What is a Cloud Storage Pool?

A Cloud Storage Pool lets you use ILM to move object data outside of your StorageGRID system. For example, you might want to move infrequently accessed objects to lower- cost cloud storage, such as Amazon S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, Google Cloud, or the Archive access tier in Microsoft Azure Blob storage. Or, you might want to maintain a cloud backup of StorageGRID objects to enhance disaster recovery.

From an ILM perspective, a Cloud Storage Pool is similar to a storage pool. To store objects in either location, you select the pool when creating the placement instructions for an ILM rule. However, while storage pools consist of Storage Nodes or Archive Nodes within the StorageGRID system, a Cloud Storage Pool consists of an external bucket (S3) or container (Azure Blob storage). Moving objects from an Archive Node to an external archival storage system through the S3 API is deprecated and has been replaced by ILM Cloud Storage Pools, which offer more functionality. If you are currently using an Archive Node with the Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3) option, migrate your objects to a Cloud Storage Pool instead.

The table compares storage pools to Cloud Storage Pools and shows the high-level similarities and differences. Storage pool

How is it created?

Using the ILM > Storage pools option in Grid Manager.

Using the ILM > Storage pools > Cloud Storage Pools option in Grid Manager.

You must set up the external bucket or container before you can create the Cloud Storage Pool.

How many pools can you create? Unlimited.

Up to 10.
