This list only includes operations available in the public API.

accounts: Operations to manage storage tenant accounts, including creating new accounts and retrieving storage usage for a given account.

alarms: Operations to list current alarms (legacy system), and return information about the health of the grid, including the current alerts and a summary of node connection states.

alert-history: Operations on resolved alerts.

alert-receivers: Operations on alert notification receivers (email).

alert-rules: Operations on alert rules.

alert-silences: Operations on alert silences.

alerts: Operations on alerts.

audit: Operations to list and update the audit configuration.

auth: Operations to perform user session authentication. The Grid Management API supports the Bearer Token Authentication Scheme. To sign in, you provide a username and password in the JSON body of the authentication request (that is, POST /api/v3/authorize). If the user is successfully authenticated, a security token is returned. This token must be provided in the header of subsequent API requests ("Authorization: Bearer token"). The token expires after 16 hours.

If single sign-on is enabled for the StorageGRID system, you must perform different steps to authenticate. See "Authenticating in to the API if single sign-on is enabled."

See "Protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery" for information about improving authentication security.

client-certificates: Operations to configure client certificates so that StorageGRID can be accessed securely using external monitoring tools. config: Operations related to the product release and versions of the Grid Management API. You can list the product release version and the major versions of the Grid Management API supported by that release, and you can disable deprecated versions of the API.

dns-servers: Operations to list and change configured external DNS servers.

drive-details: Operations on drives for specific storage appliance models.
