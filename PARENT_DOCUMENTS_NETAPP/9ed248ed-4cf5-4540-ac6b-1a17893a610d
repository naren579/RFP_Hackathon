1. Go to Configure ONTAP System Manager to enter the saved values and to complete the ONTAP side of the connection. You must add StorageGRID as a cloud tier, attach the cloud tier to a local tier to create a FabricPool, and set volume tiering policies.

2. Go to Configure the DNS server and ensure that the DNS includes a record to associate the StorageGRID server name (fully qualified domain name) to each StorageGRID IP address you will use.

3. Go to Other best practices for StorageGRID and FabricPool to learn the best practices for StorageGRID audit logs and other global configuration options. Configure StorageGRID manually

Create a high availability (HA) group for FabricPool

When configuring StorageGRID for use with FabricPool, you can optionally create one or more high availability (HA) groups. An HA group is a collection of nodes that each contain the StorageGRID Load Balancer service. An HA group can contain Gateway Nodes, Admin Nodes, or both.

You can use an HA group to help keep FabricPool data connections available. An HA group uses virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to provide highly available access to the Load Balancer service. If the active interface in the HA group fails, a backup interface can manage the workload with little impact to FabricPool operations.

For details about this task, see Manage high availability groups. To use the FabricPool setup wizard to complete this task, go to Access and complete the FabricPool setup wizard.

Before you begin

You have reviewed the best practices for high availability groups. You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

You have the Root access permission.

If you plan to use a VLAN, you have created the VLAN interface. See Configure VLAN interfaces.

Steps

1. Select CONFIGURATION > Network > High availability groups.

2. Select Create.

3. For the Enter details step, complete the following fields. Field

Description

HA group name

A unique display name for this HA group.

Description (optional) The description of this HA group.

4. For the Add interfaces step, select the node interfaces you want to use in this HA group.

Use the column headers to sort the rows, or enter a search term to locate interfaces more quickly.

738

You can select one or more nodes, but you can select only one interface for each node.

5. For the Prioritize interfaces step, determine the Primary interface and any backup interfaces for this HA group.

Drag rows to change the values in the Priority order column.

The first interface in the list is the Primary interface. The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs. Before you begin

5. For the Prioritize interfaces step, determine the Primary interface and any backup interfaces for this HA group.

Drag rows to change the values in the Priority order column.

The first interface in the list is the Primary interface. The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs.

If the HA group includes more than one interface and the active interface fails, the virtual IP (VIP) addresses move to the first backup interface in the priority order. If that interface fails, the VIP addresses move to the next backup interface, and so on. When failures are resolved, the VIP addresses move back to highest priority interface available. 6. For the Enter IP addresses step, complete the following fields.

Field

Description

Subnet CIDR

The address of the VIP subnet in CIDR notation—an IPv4 address followed by a slash and the subnet length (0-32).

The network address must not have any host bits set. For example, 192.16.0.0/22.

Gateway IP address (optional)

Optional. If the ONTAP IP addresses used to access StorageGRID aren’t on the same subnet as the StorageGRID VIP addresses, enter the StorageGRID VIP local gateway IP address. The local gateway IP address must be within the VIP subnet. Virtual IP address

Enter at least one and no more than ten VIP addresses for the active interface in the HA group. All VIP addresses must be within the VIP subnet.

At least one address must be IPv4. Optionally, you can specify additional IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
