Instead, the Archive Node\ncontinuously retries the retrieval and the value for\nRequest Failures continues to increase.\nThis alarm can indicate that the storage media\nholding the requested data is corrupt. Check the\nexternal archival storage system to further diagnose\nthe problem.\nIf you determine that the object data is no longer in\nthe archive, the object will have to be removed from\nthe StorageGRID system.
