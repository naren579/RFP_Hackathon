If you use automatic discovery:

You must include the ADMIN_IP setting for at least one grid node on any subnets that the primary Admin Node is not directly attached to. This grid node will then publish the primary Admin Node’s IP address for other nodes on the subnet to discover with mDNS.

Ensure that your network infrastructure supports passing multi-cast IP traffic within a subnet. Example node configuration files

You can use the example node configuration files to help set up the node configuration files for your StorageGRID system. The examples show node configuration files for all types of grid nodes.

For most nodes, you can add Admin and Client Network addressing information (IP, mask, gateway, and so on) when you configure the grid using the Grid Manager or the Installation API. The exception is the primary Admin Node. If you want to browse to the Admin Network IP of the primary Admin Node to complete grid configuration (because the Grid Network is not routed, for example), you must configure the Admin Network connection for the primary Admin Node in its node configuration file. This is shown in the example.

In the examples, the Client Network target has been configured as a best practice, even though the Client Network is disabled by default. Example for primary Admin Node
