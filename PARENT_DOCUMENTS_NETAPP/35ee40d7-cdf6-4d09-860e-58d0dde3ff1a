CTME

Compliance: Ingest time

For objects in compliant S3 buckets only. The object’s ingest time. You can add the retention period in minutes to this value to determine when the object can be deleted from the bucket. DMRK

Delete Marker Version ID

The version ID of the delete marker created when deleting an object from a versioned bucket. Operations on buckets don’t include this field.

CSIZ

Content size

The size of the object in bytes.

LOCS

Locations

The storage location of object data within the StorageGRID system. The value for LOCS is "" if the object has no locations (for example, it has been deleted).

CLEC: for erasure-coded objects, the erasure-coding profile ID and the erasure coding group ID that is applied to the object’s data.

CLDI: for replicated objects, the LDR node ID and the volume ID of the object’s location.

CLNL: ARC node ID of the object’s location if the object data is archived. PATH

S3 Bucket/Key or Swift Container/Object ID

The S3 bucket name and S3 key name, or the Swift container name and Swift object identifier.

RSLT

Result

The result of the ILM operation.

SUCS: The ILM operation was successful.

Description

RULE

Rules Label

If an object in a compliant S3 bucket is being deleted automatically because its retention period has expired, this field is blank.

If the object is being deleted because there are no more placement instructions that currently apply to the object, this field shows the human-readable label of the last ILM rule that applied to the object. SGRP

Site (Group)

If present, the object was deleted at the site specified, which is not the site where the object was ingested.

UUID

Universally Unique Identifier

The identifier of the object within the StorageGRID system.

VSID

Version ID

The version ID of the specific version of an object that was deleted. Operations on buckets and objects in unversioned buckets don’t include this field. LKCU: Overwritten Object Cleanup

This message is generated when StorageGRID removes an overwritten object that previously required cleanup to free up storage space. An object is overwritten when an S3 or Swift client writes an object to a path already containing a object. The removal process occurs automatically and in the background. Code

Field

Description

CSIZ

Content size

The size of the object in bytes.

LTYP

Type of cleanup

Internal use only.

LUID

Removed Object UUID

The identifier of the object that was removed.

PATH

S3 Bucket/Key or Swift Container/Object ID

The S3 bucket name and S3 key name, or the Swift container name and Swift object identifier. SEGC

Container UUID UUID of the container for the segmented object. This value is available

only if the object is segmented.

UUID

Universally Unique Identifier

The identifier of the object that still exists. This value is available only if the object has not been deleted.

LLST: Location Lost

This message is generated whenever a location for an object copy (replicated or erasure-

1357

coded) can’t be found. Code

Field

Description

CBIL

CBID

The affected CBID.

ECPR

Erasure-Coding Profile

For erasure-coded object data. The ID of the erasure-coding profile used.

LTYP

Location Type

CLDI (Online): For replicated object data

CLEC (Online): For erasure-coded object data

CLNL (Nearline): For archived replicated object data NOID

Source Node ID The node ID on which the locations were lost.

PCLD

Path to replicated object

The complete path to the disk location of the lost object data. Only returned when LTYP has a value of CLDI (that is, for replicated objects).

Takes the form /var/local/rangedb/2/p/13/13/00oJs6X%{h{U)SeUFxE@ RSLT

Result

Always NONE. RSLT is a mandatory message field, but is not relevant for this message. NONE is used rather than SUCS so that this message is not filtered.
