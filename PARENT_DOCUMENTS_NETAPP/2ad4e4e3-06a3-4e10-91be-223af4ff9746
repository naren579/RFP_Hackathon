account.

Support for Swift client applications has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Before you begin

You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a supported web browser.

You belong to a user group that has the Root access permission.

If you plan to import a federated group, you have configured identity federation, and the federated group already exists in the configured identity source. Access the Create group wizard

Steps

As your first step, access the Create group wizard.

1. Select ACCESS MANAGEMENT > Groups.

2. Select Create group.

Choose a group type

You can create a local group or import a federated group. Steps

1. Select the Local group tab to create a local group, or select the Federated group tab to import a group from the previously configured identity source.

If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, users belonging to local groups will not be able to sign in to the Tenant Manager, although they can use client applications to manage the tenant’s resources, based on group permissions.

2. Enter the group’s name.

Local group: Enter both a display name and a unique name. You can edit the display name later. ◦ Federated group: Enter the unique name. For Active Directory, the unique name is the name associated with the sAMAccountName attribute. For OpenLDAP, the unique name is the name associated with the uid attribute.

3. Select Continue. Manage group permissions

Group permissions control which tasks users can perform in the Tenant Manager and Tenant Management API.

Steps

1. For Access mode, select one of the following:

Read-write (default): Users can sign in to Tenant Manager and manage the tenant configuration. ◦ Read-only: Users can only view settings and features. They can’t make any changes or perform any operations in the Tenant Manager or Tenant Management API. Local read-only users can change their own passwords.

If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to Read-only, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.
