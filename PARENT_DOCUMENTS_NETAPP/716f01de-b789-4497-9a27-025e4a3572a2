2. Select the username and then select Sign out.

If SSO is not in use:

You are signed out of the Admin Node. The Tenant Manager sign in page is displayed.

If you signed into more than one Admin Node, you must sign out of each node.

If SSO is enabled:

You are signed out of all Admin Nodes you were accessing. The StorageGRID Sign in page is displayed. The name of the tenant account you just accessed is listed as the default in the Recent Accounts drop-down, and the tenant’s Account ID is shown.

If SSO is enabled and you are also signed in to the Grid Manager, you must also sign out of the Grid Manager to sign out of SSO. Understand Tenant Manager dashboard

The Tenant Manager dashboard provides an overview of a tenant account’s configuration and the amount of space used by objects in the tenant’s buckets (S3) or containers (Swift). If the tenant has a quota, the dashboard shows how much of the quota is used and how much is remaining. If there are any errors related to the tenant account, the errors are shown on the dashboard.

The Space used values are estimates. These estimates are affected by the timing of ingests, network connectivity, and node status.

When objects have been uploaded, the dashboard looks like the following example:

761 Tenant account summary

The top of the dashboard contains the following information:

The number of configured buckets or containers, groups, and users

The number of platform services endpoints, if any have been configured

You can select the links to view the details.

The right side of the dashboard contains the following information:

The total number of objects for the tenant.

For an S3 account, if no objects have been ingested and you have the Root access permission, getting started guidelines appear instead of the total number of objects.

Tenant details, including the tenant account name and ID and whether the tenant can use platform services, its own identity source, grid federation, or S3 Select (only the permissions that are enabled are listed). Storage and quota usage

The Storage usage panel contains the following information:

The amount of object data for the tenant.

762

This value indicates the total amount of object data uploaded and does not represent the space used to store copies of those objects and their metadata. The Space used values are estimates. These estimates are affected by the timing of ingests, network connectivity, and node status.

This value indicates the total amount of object data uploaded and does not represent the space used to store copies of those objects and their metadata.

If a quota is set, the total amount of space available for object data and the amount and percentage of space remaining. The quota limits the amount of object data that can be ingested. Quota usage is based on internal estimates and might be exceeded in some cases. For example, StorageGRID checks the quota when a tenant starts uploading objects and rejects new ingests if the tenant has exceeded the quota. However, StorageGRID does not take into account the size of the current upload when determining if the quota has been exceeded. If objects are deleted, a tenant might be temporarily prevented from uploading new objects until the quota usage is recalculated. Quota usage calculations can take 10 minutes or longer.

A bar chart that represents the relative sizes of the largest buckets or containers.

You can place your cursor over any of the chart segments to view the total space consumed by that bucket or container.

To correspond with the bar chart, a list of the largest buckets or containers, including the total amount of object data and the number of objects for each bucket or container. If the tenant has more than nine buckets or containers, all other buckets or containers are combined into a single entry at the bottom of the list.
