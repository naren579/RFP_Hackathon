Initial deployment of a node

When you first deploy a node, you must attach the node to the Grid Network and ensure it has access to the primary Admin Node. If the Grid Network is isolated, you can configure the Admin Network on the primary Admin Node for configuration and installation access from outside the Grid Network.

A Grid Network with a gateway configured becomes the default gateway for a node during deployment. The default gateway allows grid nodes on separate subnets to communicate with the primary Admin Node before the grid has been configured.

If necessary, subnets containing NTP servers or requiring access to the Grid Manager or API can also be configured as grid subnets. Automatic node registration with primary Admin Node

After the nodes are deployed, they register themselves with the primary Admin Node using the Grid Network. You can then use the Grid Manager, the configure-storagegrid.py Python script, or the Installation API to configure the grid and approve the registered nodes. During grid configuration, you can configure multiple grid subnets. Static routes to these subnets through the Grid Network gateway will be created on each node when you complete grid configuration. Disabling the Admin Network or Client Network

If you want to disable the Admin Network or Client Network, you can remove the configuration from them during the node approval process, or you can use the Change IP tool after installation is complete (see Configure IP addresses). Post-installation guidelines

After completing grid node deployment and configuration, follow these guidelines for DHCP addressing and network configuration changes.

If DHCP was used to assign IP addresses, configure a DHCP reservation for each IP address on the networks being used.

You can only set up DHCP during the deployment phase. You can’t set up DHCP during configuration.

Nodes reboot when their IP addresses change, which can cause outages if a DHCP address change affects multiple nodes at the same time.

You must use the Change IP procedures if you want to change IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for a grid node. See Configure IP addresses.

If you make networking configuration changes, including routing and gateway changes, client connectivity to the primary Admin Node and other grid nodes might be lost. Depending on the networking changes

applied, you might need to reestablish these connections. Network port reference

You must ensure the network infrastructure can provide internal and external communication between nodes within the grid and to external clients and services. You might need access across internal and external firewalls, switching systems, and routing systems.

The StorageGRID internal firewall allows incoming connections to specific ports on the Grid Network. Connections are also accepted on ports defined by load balancer endpoints.

NetApp recommends that you enable Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic between grid nodes. Allowing ICMP traffic can improve failover performance when a grid node can’t be reached.
