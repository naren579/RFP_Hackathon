You use the Grid Manager to define all of the information required to configure your StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

The primary Admin Node must be deployed and have completed the initial startup sequence.

Steps

1. Open your web browser and navigate to one of the following addresses: https://primary_admin_node_ip

client_network_ip

Alternatively, you can access the Grid Manager on port 8443:

https://primary_admin_node_ip:8443

You can use the IP address for the primary Admin Node IP on the Grid Network or on the Admin Network, as appropriate for your network configuration.

2. Select Install a StorageGRID system.

The page used to configure a StorageGRID system appears.

Specify the StorageGRID license information

You must specify the name for your StorageGRID system and upload the license file provided by NetApp. Steps

1. On the License page, enter a meaningful name for your StorageGRID system in the Grid Name field.

After installation, the name is displayed at the top of the Nodes menu.

2. Select Browse, locate the NetApp license file (NLF-unique-id.txt), and select Open.

The license file is validated, and the serial number is displayed.

The StorageGRID installation archive includes a free license that does not provide any support entitlement for the product. You can update to a license that offers support after installation.

3. Select Next.

Add sites

You must create at least one site when you are installing StorageGRID. You can create additional sites to increase the reliability and storage capacity of your StorageGRID system. Steps

1. On the Sites page, enter the Site Name.

2. To add additional sites, click the plus sign next to the last site entry and enter the name in the new Site Name text box.

Add as many additional sites as required for your grid topology. You can add up to 16 sites.

3. Click Next.

Specify Grid Network subnets

You must specify the subnets that are used on the Grid Network. About this task

The subnet entries include the subnets for the Grid Network for each site in your StorageGRID system, along with any subnets that need to be reachable through the Grid Network.

If you have multiple grid subnets, the Grid Network gateway is required. All grid subnets specified must be reachable through this gateway. Steps

1. Specify the CIDR network address for at least one Grid Network in the Subnet 1 text box. The license file is validated, and the serial number is displayed.

3. Click Next.

Approve pending grid nodes

You must approve each grid node before it can join the StorageGRID system.

Before you begin

You have deployed all virtual and StorageGRID appliance grid nodes.

It is more efficient to perform one single installation of all the nodes, rather than installing some nodes now and some nodes later. Steps

1. Review the Pending Nodes list, and confirm that it shows all of the grid nodes you deployed.

If a grid node is missing, confirm that it was deployed successfully.

2. Select the radio button next to a pending node you want to approve.

3. Click Approve.

4. In General Settings, modify settings for the following properties, as necessary:

Site: The system name of the site for this grid node. â—¦ Name: The system name for the node. The name defaults to the name you specified when you configured the node.
