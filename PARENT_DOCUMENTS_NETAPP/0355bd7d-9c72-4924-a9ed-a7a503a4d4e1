If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for the StorageGRID system, you must perform different steps to authenticate. See the instructions for using the Grid Management API. config: Operations related to the product release and versions of the Tenant Management API. You can list the product release version and the major versions of the API supported by that release.

containers: Operations on S3 buckets or Swift containers.

groups: Operations to manage local tenant groups and to retrieve federated tenant groups from an external identity source.

identity-source: Operations to configure an external identity source and to manually synchronize federated group and user information.

ilm: Operations on information lifecycle management (ILM) settings. regions: Operations to determine which regions have been configured for the StorageGRID system.

s3: Operations to manage S3 access keys for tenant users.

Issue API requests

Any API operations you perform using the API Docs webpage are live operations. Be careful not to create, update, or delete configuration data or other data by mistake. Steps

1. Select the HTTP action to see the request details.

2. Determine if the request requires additional parameters, such as a group or user ID. Then, obtain these values. You might need to issue a different API request first to get the information you need.

3. Determine if you need to modify the example request body. If so, you can select Model to learn the requirements for each field.

4. Select Try it out.

5. Provide any required parameters, or modify the request body as required.

6. Select Execute.

7. Review the response code to determine if the request was successful. Tenant Management API versioning

The Tenant Management API uses versioning to support non-disruptive upgrades.

For example, this Request URL specifies version 4 of the API.

https://hostname_or_ip_address/api/v4/authorize When you expand each API operation, you can see its HTTP action, endpoint URL, a list of any required or optional parameters, an example of the request body (when required), and the possible responses.

The major version of the API is bumped when changes are made that are not compatible with older versions. The minor version of the API is bumped when changes are made that are compatible with older versions. Compatible changes include the addition of new endpoints or new properties.

The following example illustrates how the API version is bumped based on the type of changes made.

When you install StorageGRID software for the first time, only the most recent version of the API is enabled. However, when you upgrade to a new feature release of StorageGRID, you continue to have access to the older API version for at least one StorageGRID feature release.
