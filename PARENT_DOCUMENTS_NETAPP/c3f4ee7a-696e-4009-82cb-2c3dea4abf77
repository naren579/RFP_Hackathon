Learn about the specifics of StorageGRID networking.

Gather and prepare the Required information and materials.

Prepare the required CPU and RAM.

Provide for storage and performance requirements.

Prepare the Linux servers that will host your StorageGRID nodes. Deployment

Deploy grid nodes. When you deploy grid nodes, they are created as part of the StorageGRID system and connected to one or more networks.

• To deploy software-based grid nodes on the hosts you prepared in step 1, use the Linux command line and

node configuration files.

To deploy StorageGRID appliance nodes, follow the Quick start for hardware installation. Configuration

When all nodes have been deployed, use the Grid Manager to configure the grid and complete the installation.

Automate the installation

To save time and provide consistency, you can automate the installation of the StorageGRID host service and the configuration of grid nodes.

Use a standard orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate:

Installation of Ubuntu or Debian ◦ Configuration of networking and storage ◦ Installation of the container engine and the StorageGRID host service ◦ Deployment of virtual grid nodes

See Automate the installation and configuration of the StorageGRID host service.

After you deploy grid nodes, automate the configuration of the StorageGRID system using the Python configuration script provided in the installation archive.

Automate the installation and configuration of appliance grid nodes If you are an advanced developer of StorageGRID deployments, automate the installation of grid nodes by using the installation REST API.

Plan and prepare for installation on Ubuntu or Debian

Required information and materials

Before you install StorageGRID, gather and prepare the required information and materials.

Required information Network plan

Which networks you intend to attach to each StorageGRID node. StorageGRID supports multiple networks for traffic separation, security, and administrative convenience.

See the StorageGRID Networking guidelines.

Network information

Unless you are using DHCP, IP addresses to assign to each grid node and the IP addresses of the DNS and NTP servers. Servers for grid nodes

Identify a set of servers (physical, virtual, or both) that, in aggregate, provide sufficient resources to support the number and type of StorageGRID nodes you plan to deploy.

138

If your StorageGRID installation will not use StorageGRID appliance (hardware) Storage Nodes, you must use hardware RAID storage with battery-backed write cache (BBWC). StorageGRID does not support the use of virtual storage area networks (vSANs), software RAID, or no RAID protection.

Node migration (if needed)

Understand the requirements for node migration, if you want to perform scheduled maintenance on physical hosts without any service interruption.

Required materials

NetApp StorageGRID license

You must have a valid, digitally signed NetApp license.

A non-production license, which can be used for testing and proof of concept grids, is included in the StorageGRID installation archive.

StorageGRID installation archive

Download the StorageGRID installation archive and extract the files. Service laptop

The StorageGRID system is installed through a service laptop.

The service laptop must have:

Network port

SSH client (for example, PuTTY)

Supported web browser
