Protocol Used by NFS-based audit export (nfs).

Note: This port is required only if NFS-based audit export is enabled.

Note: Support for NFS has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Provides the multicast DNS (mDNS) service that is used for full-grid IP changes and for primary Admin Node discovery during installation, expansion, and recovery.

Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) external traffic from appliances configured for node encryption to the Key Management Server (KMS), unless a different port is specified on the KMS configuration page of the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. SSH on port 8022 grants access to the base operating system on appliance and virtual node platforms for support and troubleshooting. This port is not used for Linux-based (bare metal) nodes and is not required to be accessible between grid nodes or during normal operations.

Optional. Used by web browsers and management API clients for accessing the Grid Manager. Can be used to separate Grid Manager and Tenant Manager communications.

Note: If you close Grid Manager ports 443 or 8443, any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list. See Configure firewall controls to configure privileged IP addresses.

Grants access to StorageGRID appliances in pre-configuration mode for support and troubleshooting. This port is not required to be accessible between grid nodes or during normal operations.

Used by external Grafana services for secure access to the StorageGRID Prometheus service.

Note: This port is required only if certificate- based Prometheus access is enabled.

Used for platform services messages sent to a Kafka cluster. Tenants can override the default Kafka port setting of 9092 when creating an endpoint. Optional. Used by web browsers and management API clients for accessing the Tenant Manager. Can be used to separate Grid Manager and Tenant Manager communications.

All nodes on the source grid for cross-grid replication

Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes on the destination grid for cross-grid replication

This range of ports is reserved for grid federation connections. Both grids in a given connection use the same port. Quick start for StorageGRID

Follow these high-level steps to configure and use any StorageGRID system.

Learn, plan, and collect data

Work with your NetApp account representative to understand the options and to plan your new StorageGRID system. Consider these types of questions:

How much object data do you expect to store initially and over time?

How many sites do you need?

How many and what types of nodes do you need at each site?

Which StorageGRID networks will you use?

Who will use your grid to store objects? Which applications will they use?

Do you have any special security or storage requirements? S3 client traffic directly to Storage Nodes (HTTPS).
