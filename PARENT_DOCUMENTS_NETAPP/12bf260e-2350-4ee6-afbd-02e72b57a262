When trusted, all ports opened under the Manage external access tab are accessible, as well as any load balancer endpoints opened on the Client Network.

The settings you make on one tab can affect the access changes you make on another tab. Be sure to check the settings on all tabs to ensure your network behaves in the way you expect.

To configure internal firewall controls, see Configure firewall controls.

The Privileged address list tab enables you to register one or more IP addresses that are granted access to grid ports that are closed. The Manage external access tab enables you to close external access to selected external ports or all open external ports (external ports are ports that are accessible by non-grid nodes by default). These two tabs often can be used together to customize the exact network access you need to allow for your grid.

Privileged IP addresses don’t have internal grid port access by default.

Example 1: Use a jump host for maintenance tasks

Suppose you want to use a jump host (a security hardened host) for network administration. You could use these general steps:

1. Use the Privileged address list tab to add the IP address of the jump host.

2. Use the Manage external access tab to block all ports. Add the privileged IP address before you block ports 443 and 8443. Any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list.

After you save your configuration, all external ports on the Admin Node in your grid will be blocked for all hosts except the jump host. You can then use the jump host to perform maintenance tasks on your grid more securely. Example 2: Limit access to the Grid Manager and Tenant Manager

Suppose you want to limit access to the Grid Manager and Tenant manager (preset ports) for security reasons. You could use these general steps:

448

1. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to block port 443.

2. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to allow access to port 8443.

3. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to allow access to port 9443.

After you save your configuration, hosts will not be able to access port 443, but they can still access the Grid Manager through port 8443 and the Tenant Manager through port 9443.

Ports 443, 8443, and 9443 are the preset ports for Grid Manager and Tenant Manager. You can toggle any port to limit access to a specific Grid Manager or Tenant manager. Example 3: Lock down sensitive ports

Suppose you want to lock down sensitive ports and the service on that port (for example, SSH on port 22). You could use the following general steps:

1. Use the Privileged address list tab to grant access only to the hosts that need access to the service.

2. Use the Manage external access tab to block all ports. Suppose you want to limit access to the Grid Manager and Tenant manager (preset ports) for security reasons. You could use these general steps:

448

1. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to block port 443.

2. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to allow access to port 8443.

3. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to allow access to port 9443.

After you save your configuration, hosts will not be able to access port 443, but they can still access the Grid Manager through port 8443 and the Tenant Manager through port 9443.

Ports 443, 8443, and 9443 are the preset ports for Grid Manager and Tenant Manager. You can toggle any port to limit access to a specific Grid Manager or Tenant manager. Example 3: Lock down sensitive ports

Suppose you want to lock down sensitive ports and the service on that port (for example, SSH on port 22). You could use the following general steps:

1. Use the Privileged address list tab to grant access only to the hosts that need access to the service.

2. Use the Manage external access tab to block all ports.

Add the privileged IP address before you block access to any ports assigned to access Grid Manager and Tenant manager (preset ports are 443 and 8443). Any users currently connected on a blocked port, including you, will lose access to Grid Manager unless their IP address has been added to the Privileged address list.

After you save your configuration, port 22 and SSH service will be available to hosts on the privileged address list. All other hosts will be denied access to the service no matter what interface the request comes from. Example 4: Disable access to unused services

At a network level, you could disable some services that you don’t intend to use. For example if you will not provide Swift access, you would perform the following general steps:

1. Use the toggle on the Manage external access tab to block port 18083.
