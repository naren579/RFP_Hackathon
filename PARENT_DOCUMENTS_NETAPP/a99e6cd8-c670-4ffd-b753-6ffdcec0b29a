Check the network router, switch, and adapter configurations.

Restart the server.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

The following can be causes of NRER alarms:

Forward error correction (FEC) mismatch

Switch port and NIC MTU mismatch

High link error rates

NIC ring buffer overrun

See information about troubleshooting the Network Receive Error (NRER) alarm in Troubleshoot network, hardware, and platform issues.

If audit relays aren’t connected to ADC services, audit events can’t be reported. They are queued and unavailable to users until the connection is restored. Restore connectivity to an ADC service as soon as possible.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of NMS Status is DB Connectivity Error, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of NMS State is Standby, continue monitoring and if the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of NMS State is Offline, restart the service. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

This can be caused by network connectivity or driver compatibility issues. If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If an alarm is triggered, check how fast database usage has been changing. A sudden drop (as opposed to a gradual change over time) indicates an error condition.

Adjusting the alarm threshold allows you to proactively manage when additional storage needs to be allocated.

If the available space reaches a low threshold (see alarm threshold), contact technical support to change the database allocation.

These errors can clear without being manually reset. If they don’t clear, check network hardware. Check that the adapter hardware and driver are correctly installed and configured to work with your network routers and switches.

When the underlying problem is resolved, reset the counter. Select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology. Then select site > grid node > SSM > Resources > Configuration > Main, select Reset Transmit Error Count, and click Apply Changes. If the frequency offset exceeds the configured threshold, there is likely a hardware problem with the local clock. If the problem persists, contact technical support to arrange a replacement.

If the NTP daemon is not locked to an external time source, check network connectivity to the designated external time sources, their availability, and their stability.

If the time offset exceeds the configured threshold, there is likely a hardware problem with the oscillator of the local clock. If the problem persists, contact technical support to arrange a replacement.

This value indicates the reliability and stability of the time source that NTP on the local server is using as its reference.

If an alarm is triggered, it can be an indication that the time source’s oscillator is defective, or that there is a problem with the WAN link to the time source.
