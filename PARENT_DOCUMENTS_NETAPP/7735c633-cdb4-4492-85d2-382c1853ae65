Preferred sender Admin Node

If your StorageGRID deployment includes multiple Admin Nodes, the primary Admin Node is the preferred sender for alert notifications, AutoSupport packages, SNMP traps and informs, and legacy alarm notifications.

Under normal system operations, only the preferred sender sends notifications. However, all other Admin Nodes monitor the preferred sender. If a problem is detected, other Admin Nodes act as standby senders.

Multiple notifications might sent in these cases:

If Admin Nodes become "islanded" from each other, both the preferred sender and the standby senders will attempt to send notifications, and multiple copies of notifications might be received. If standby sender detects problems with the preferred sender and starts sending notifications, the preferred sender might regain its ability to send notifications. If this occurs, duplicate notifications might be sent. The standby sender will stop sending notifications when it no longer detects errors on the preferred sender.

When you test AutoSupport packages, all Admin Nodes send the test. When you test alert notifications, you must sign in to every Admin Node to verify connectivity. Primary services for Admin Nodes

The following table shows the primary services for Admin Nodes; however, this table does not list all node services.

15

Service

Key function

Audit Management System

Tracks system activity and events.

(AMS)

Configuration Management Node

Manages system-wide configuration.

(CMN) High Availability

Manages high availability virtual IP addresses for groups of Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes.

Note: This service is also found on Gateway Nodes.

Load Balancer

Provides load balancing of S3 and Swift traffic from clients to Storage Nodes.

Note: This service is also found on Gateway Nodes. Management Application Program Interface (mgmt-api)

Processes requests from the Grid Management API and the Tenant Management API.

Network Management System

Provides functionality for the Grid Manager.

(NMS)

Prometheus

Collects and stores time-series metrics from the services on all nodes.

Server Status Monitor (SSM) Monitors the operating system and underlying hardware.

What is a Storage Node?

Storage Nodes manage and store object data and metadata. Storage Nodes include the services and processes required to store, move, verify, and retrieve object data and metadata on disk.

Each site in your StorageGRID system must have at least three Storage Nodes. Types of Storage Nodes

All Storage Nodes that were installed before StorageGRID 11.8 store both objects and the metadata for those objects. Starting in StorageGRID 11.8, you can choose the Storage Node type for new software-based storage nodes:

Object and metadata Storage Nodes

By default, all new Storage Nodes installed in StorageGRID 11.8 will store both objects and metadata. Metadata-only Storage Nodes (software-based nodes only)
