Each message sent to the external syslog to have the same severity value as when it was logged locally onto the node:

For audit logs, the severity is "info."

For security events, the severity values are generated by the Linux distribution on the nodes.

For application logs, the severities vary between "info" and "notice," depending on what the issue is. For example, adding an NTP server and configuring an HA group gives a value of "info," while intentionally stopping the SSM or RSM service gives a value of "notice."

If you select a value, it will be applied to all messages of this type. Information about different facilities will be lost if you override facility with a fixed value. Facility

Description

Passthrough

Each message sent to the external syslog to have the same facility value as when it was logged locally onto the node:

For audit logs, the facility sent to the external syslog server is "local7."

For security events, the facility values are generated by the linux distribution on the nodes.

For application logs, the application logs sent to the external syslog server have the following facility values: ◦ bycast.log: user or daemon ◦ bycast-err.log: user, daemon, local3, or local4 ◦ jaeger.log: local2 ◦ nms.log: local3 ◦ prometheus.log: local4 ◦ raft.log: local5 ◦ hagroups.log: local6

Send test messages

Before starting to use an external syslog server, you should request that all nodes in your grid send test messages to the external syslog server. You should use these test messages to help you validate your entire log collection infrastructure before you commit to sending data to the external syslog server.

Don’t use the external syslog server configuration until you confirm that the external syslog server received a test message from each node in your grid and that the message was processed as expected. Steps

1. If you don’t want to send test messages because you are certain your external syslog server is configured properly and can receive audit information from all the nodes in your grid, select Skip and finish.

A green banner indicates that the configuration has been saved.

2. Otherwise, select Send test messages (recommended).

1193

Test results continuously appear on the page until you stop the test. While the test is in progress, your audit messages continue to be sent to your previously configured destinations.

3. If you receive any errors, correct them and select Send test messages again.

See Troubleshoot an external syslog server to help you resolve any errors.

4. Wait until you see a green banner indicating all nodes have passed testing.

5. Check your syslog server to determine if test messages are being received and processed as expected. If you are using UDP, check your entire log collection infrastructure. The UDP protocol does not allow for as rigorous error detection as the other protocols.

6. Select Stop and finish.

You are returned to the Audit and syslog server page. A green banner indicates that the syslog server configuration has been saved.
