An alarm is raised if the Cassandra metadata store becomes unavailable.

Check the status of Cassandra:

1. At the Storage Node, log in as admin and su to root using the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

2. Enter: service cassandra status

3. If Cassandra is not running, restart it: service cassandra restart

This alarm might also indicate that the metadata store (Cassandra database) for a Storage Node requires rebuilding. See information about troubleshooting the Services: Status - Cassandra (SVST) alarm in Troubleshoot metadata issues.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

This alarm is triggered during installation or expansion to indicate a new data store is joining the grid.

This alarm is triggered if the status of the compute controller hardware in a StorageGRID appliance is Needs Attention.

Recommended action

This alarm is triggered when the Metadata Effective Space (CEMS) reaches 70% full (minor alarm), 90% full (major alarm), and 100% full (critical alarm).

If this alarm reaches the 90% threshold, a warning appears on the dashboard in the Grid Manager. You must perform an expansion procedure to add new Storage Nodes as soon as possible. See Expand a grid.

If this alarm reaches the 100% threshold, you must stop ingesting objects and add Storage Nodes immediately. Cassandra requires a certain amount of space to perform essential operations such as compaction and repair. These operations will be impacted if object metadata uses more than 100% of the allowed space. Undesirable results can occur.

Note: Contact technical support if you are unable to add Storage Nodes.

After new Storage Nodes are added, the system automatically rebalances object metadata across all Storage Nodes, and the alarm clears. Also see information about troubleshooting the Low metadata storage alert in Troubleshoot metadata issues.

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

If the value of CMN Status is Error, select SUPPORT > Tools > Grid topology, then select site > grid node > CMN > Overview > Main and CMN > Alarms > Main to determine the cause of the error and to troubleshoot the problem.

An alarm is triggered and the value of CMN Status is No Online CMN during a hardware refresh of the primary Admin Node when the CMNs are switched (the value of the old CMN State is Standby and the new is Online).

If the problem persists, contact technical support.

An alarm is triggered if the remaining capacity (number of available connections that can be opened to the NMS database) falls below the configured alarm severity. If this alarm reaches the 100% threshold, you must stop ingesting objects and add Storage Nodes immediately.

Recommended action

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with power supply A in the compute controller for a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

An alarm is triggered if there is an issue with power supply B in the compute controller for a StorageGRID appliance.

If necessary, replace the component.

An alarm is triggered if the temperature of the CPU in the compute controller in a StorageGRID appliance exceeds a nominal threshold.

If the Storage Node is a StorageGRID appliance, the StorageGRID system indicates that the controller needs attention.
