GRID_NETWORK_MTU = 8192

If omitted, 1400 is used. GRID_NETWORK_MASK: The network mask for the Grid Network. If all or most of the nodes use the same network mask, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example:

GRID_NETWORK_MASK = 255.255.255.0

GRID_NETWORK_GATEWAY: The network gateway for the Grid Network. If all or most of the nodes use the same network gateway, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying

213

different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: GRID_NETWORK_GATEWAY = 10.1.0.1

GRID_NETWORK_MTU: Optional. The maximum transmission unit (MTU) on the Grid Network. If specified, the value must be between 1280 and 9216. For example:

GRID_NETWORK_MTU = 8192

If omitted, 1400 is used.

If you want to use jumbo frames, set the MTU to a value suitable for jumbo frames, such as 9000. Otherwise, keep the default value.

The MTU value of the network must match the value configured on the switch port the node is connected to. Otherwise, network performance issues or packet loss might occur.

For the best network performance, all nodes should be configured with similar MTU values on their Grid Network interfaces. The Grid Network MTU mismatch alert is triggered if there is a significant difference in MTU settings for the Grid Network on individual nodes. The MTU values donâ€™t have to be the same for all network types. ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG: The method used to acquire IP addresses, either DISABLED, STATIC, or DHCP. The default is DISABLED. If all or most of the nodes use the same method for acquiring IP addresses, you can specify that method here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: ADMIN_NETWORK_CONFIG = STATIC

ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET: The name of an existing VMware network to use for the Admin Network. This setting is required unless the Admin Network is disabled. If all or most of the nodes use the same network name, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: ADMIN_NETWORK_TARGET = SG-Admin-Network

ADMIN_NETWORK_MASK: The network mask for the Admin Network. This setting is required if you are using static IP addressing. If all or most of the nodes use the same network mask, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: ADMIN_NETWORK_MASK = 255.255.255.0

ADMIN_NETWORK_GATEWAY: The network gateway for the Admin Network. This setting is required if you are using static IP addressing and you specify external subnets in the ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL

214

setting. (That is, it is not required if ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL is empty.) If all or most of the nodes use the same network gateway, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: ADMIN_NETWORK_GATEWAY = 10.3.0.1

ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL: The external subnet list (routes) for the Admin Network, specified as a comma- separated list of CIDR route destinations. If all or most of the nodes use the same external subnet list, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example:

ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL = 172.16.0.0/21,172.17.0.0/21 ADMIN_NETWORK_GATEWAY: The network gateway for the Admin Network. This setting is required if you are using static IP addressing and you specify external subnets in the ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL

214

setting. (That is, it is not required if ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL is empty.) If all or most of the nodes use the same network gateway, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example: ADMIN_NETWORK_GATEWAY = 10.3.0.1

ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL: The external subnet list (routes) for the Admin Network, specified as a comma- separated list of CIDR route destinations. If all or most of the nodes use the same external subnet list, you can specify it here. You can then override the global setting by specifying different settings for one or more individual nodes. For example:

ADMIN_NETWORK_ESL = 172.16.0.0/21,172.17.0.0/21
