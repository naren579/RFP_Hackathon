e. Find the PCLD field and the NOID field in the LLST message.

If present, the value of PCLD is the complete path on disk to the missing replicated object copy. The value of NOID is the node id of the LDR where a copy of the object might be found.

If you find an object location, you might be able to restore the object.

f. Find the Storage Node associated with this LDR node ID. In the Grid Manager, select SUPPORT >

Tools > Grid topology. Then select Data Center > Storage Node > LDR. The Node ID for the LDR service is in the Node Information table. Review the information for each Storage Node until you find the one that hosts this LDR.

2. Determine if the object exists on the Storage Node indicated in the audit message:

a. Log in to the grid node:

1267

i. Enter the following command: ssh admin@grid_node_IP

ii. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

iii. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

iv. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #. b. Determine if the file path for the object exists. e. Find the PCLD field and the NOID field in the LLST message.

If present, the value of PCLD is the complete path on disk to the missing replicated object copy. The value of NOID is the node id of the LDR where a copy of the object might be found.

iii. Enter the following command to switch to root: su -

iv. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from $ to #. b. Determine if the file path for the object exists.

For the file path of the object, use the value of PCLD from the LLST audit message.

For example, enter:

ls '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6'

Always enclose the object file path in single quotes in commands to escape any special characters.

▪ If the object path is not found, the object is lost and can’t be restored using this procedure. Contact technical support.

▪ If the object path is found, continue with the next step. You can attempt to restore the found object

back to StorageGRID.

3. If the object path was found, attempt to restore the object to StorageGRID:

a. From the same Storage Node, change the ownership of the object file so that it can be managed by StorageGRID. Enter: chown ldr-user:bycast 'file_path_of_object'

b. Telnet to localhost 1402 to access the LDR console. Enter: telnet 0 1402

c. Enter: cd /proc/STOR

d. Enter: Object_Found 'file_path_of_object'

For example, enter: Object_Found '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6'

Issuing the Object\_Found command notifies the grid of the object’s location. It also triggers the active ILM policies, which make additional copies as specified in each policy.

If the Storage Node where you found the object is offline, you can copy the object to any Storage Node that is online. Place the object in any /var/local/rangedb directory of the online Storage Node. Then, issue the Object\_Found command using that file path to the object.

▪ If the object can’t be restored, the Object\_Found command fails. Contact technical support. ▪ If the object was successfully restored to StorageGRID, a success message appears. For example:

1268

ade 12448208: /proc/STOR > Object_Found '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6' ade 12448208: /proc/STOR > Object found succeeded. First packet of file was valid. Extracted key: 38186FE53E3C49A5 Renamed '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6' to '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRt78Ila#3udu'

Continue with the next step.

4. If the object was successfully restored to StorageGRID, verify that new locations were created. a. Enter: cd /proc/OBRP

b. Enter: ObjectByUUID UUID_value ▪ If the object can’t be restored, the Object\_Found command fails. Contact technical support. ▪ If the object was successfully restored to StorageGRID, a success message appears. For example:

1268

ade 12448208: /proc/STOR > Object_Found '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6' ade 12448208: /proc/STOR > Object found succeeded. First packet of file was valid. Extracted key: 38186FE53E3C49A5 Renamed '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRs&LgA%#3tN6' to '/var/local/rangedb/1/p/17/11/00rH0%DkRt78Ila#3udu'

Continue with the next step.
