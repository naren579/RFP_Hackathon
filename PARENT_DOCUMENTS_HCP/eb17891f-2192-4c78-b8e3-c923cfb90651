Meaning

Description

204

No Content

HCP successfully aborted the multipart upload.

403

Forbidden

Possible reasons include:

The request specifies anonymous access. Only an authenticated user can abort a multipart upload. The credentials provided with the request are invalid. The credentials provided with the request do not match the credentials used to initiate the multipart upload or the credentials for the owner of the bucket where the multipart upload is being performed. You do not have permission to abort multipart uploads in the specified bucket. The S3 compatible API is currently disabled for the specified bucket.

404 Not Found

One of these:

The specified multipart upload does not exist. Either the upload ID is invalid, or the multipart upload was already aborted or completed. The specified bucket does not exist.

500

Internal Server Error

An internal error occurred.

If this error persists, contact your tenant administrator.

503 Service Unavailable

HCP is temporarily unable to handle the request, probably due to system overload, maintenance, or upgrade. Try the request again, gradually increasing the delay between each successive attempt.

If this error persists, contact your tenant administrator.

Working with POST object uploads

With the Hitachi API for Amazon S3, you can accept objects uploaded directly to HCP from web browser forms (that is, a POST form request). This process is called a POST object upload.

This section of the Help starts with general information about and considerations for working with POST object uploads.
