For example, Fri, 18 Sep 2020 21:02:13 GMT. This header contains the same datetime value as the X-HCP-ChangeTimeMilliseconds and X-HCP-ChangeTimeString headers, but in a format that can be used directly in If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since request headers. ETag

The ETag of the object or version enclosed in double quotation marks ("). This header is returned only if the object has an ETag.

X-HCP-ACL

A true or false value indicating whether the object has an ACL.

X-HCP-ChangeTimeMilliseconds

The change time for the object, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, followed by an integer that is unique for the change time. For example: 1336483100178.00. X-HCP-ChangeTimeString

The change time for the object in this format:

yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, Z represents the offset from UTC and is specified as:

(+|-)hhmm

For example, 2020-09-18T09:18:20-0400 represents the start of the 20th second into 9:18 AM, September 18, 2020, EDT. X-HCP-CurrentStorageNode

The IP address of a node on which object data is stored. You may get better performance retrieving an object if you use this IP address in the GET request for the object instead of using a host name in the request URL.

This header is returned only if both of these are true:

HCP is configured to return the header.

HCP has determined that a GET request for the object is likely to have better performance if the request is targeted to the IP address specified by the header. X-HCP-Custom-Metadata

A true or false value indicating whether the object has any annotations.

X-HCP-CustomMetadataAnnotations

A comma-and-space-separated list containing the names and sizes of all object annotations. Each entry in the list consists of the annotation name, a semicolon (;) and the annotation size in bytes. For example: report_data; 12908. This header is returned only if X-HCP-Custom-Metadata is true. X-HCP-Domain

The Active Directory domain that contains the user identified by the X-HCP-Owner header. This value is an empty string if the X-HCP-Owner header identifies a user account defined in HCP or if the object has no owner. If the X-HCP-Owner header returns a user account ID or nobody, the value of the X-HCP-Domain header is one of several invalid domains that begin with the percent sign (%). These values have meanings internal to the HCP system. X-HCP-DPL

The data protection level for the object.

X-HCP-GID

The POSIX group ID for the object.

For objects added through the NFS protocol, this value is determined by the NFS client. This value is an empty string if either of these conditions is true:

The object was added through a protocol other than NFS and neither the UID nor the GID for the object has been changed.

The HCP product-specific owner of the object was changed. X-HCP-Hash

The cryptographic hash algorithm HCP uses, along with the cryptographic hash value stored for the object, in this format:

X-HCP-Hash: hash-algorithmhash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored data is the same as the data you sent. To perform the verification, compare this value with a hash value that you

generate from the original data.

The

X-HCP-Hash

header is not returned for multipart objects. X-HCP-Index

A true or false value indicating whether the object is marked for indexing.

X-HCP-IngestProtocol

The namespace access protocol through which the object was added to the namespace. Possible values are:

CIFS_NFS HTTP

SMTP WebDAV
