Required headers

The list below describes the headers you can use in a request to list in-progress multipart uploads. Authorization

Specifies user credentials or requests anonymous access.

Date

Specifies the date and time when the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time.

The date and time must always be specified using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To specify the date and time, use this format: DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

In this format:

DDD

The three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Mon).

dd

The two-digit day of the month.

MMM

The three-letter abbreviation for the month, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Feb). yyyy

The four-digit year.

HH

The hour on a 24-hour clock.

mm

The number of minutes.

ss

The number of seconds.

For example:

Thu, 23 Mar 2017 14:27:05 +0000

All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date

Specifies the date and time at which the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. For the valid values for this header, see the description of the Date header above.

Response headers

The list below describes the headers returned in response to a successful request to list in-progress multipart uploads. Content-Type

Specifies the Internet media type of the response body. For a request to list the parts of a multipart upload, the value of this header is always application/xml;charset=UT F-8.

The date and time when HCP responded to the request, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The date and time are returned in this format: DDD dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss GMT

For example:

Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:27:05 GMT

Transfer-Encoding

Indicates that HCP could not determine the size of the response body before formulating the response. For a request to list the buckets you own, the value of this header is always chunked.

Response body

The list below describes the XML elements in the response body returned in response to a request to list the multipart uploads that are in progress in a bucket. The elements are listed in alphabetical order. Bucket

Child of the ListMultipartUploadsResult element. The Bucket element specifies the name of the bucket targeted by the request.

CommonPrefixes

Child of the ListMultipartUploadsResult and container for the Prefix element. The response body contains one CommonPrefixes element for each common prefix in the multipart upload listing. Delimiter

Child of the ListMultipartUploadsResult element. The Delimiter element specifies the value of the delimiter query parameter included in the request. If the request did not include the delimiter query parameter, the response body does not include the Delimiter element.
