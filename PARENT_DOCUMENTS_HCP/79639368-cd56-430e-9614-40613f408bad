For example, this GET request filters the list of namespaces for the Finance tenant by names beginning with the string accounts: curl -k -i -H "Accept: application/xml" -H "Authorization: HCP bGdyZWVu:a3b9c163f6c520407ff34cfdb83ca5c6" "https://finance.hcp.example.com:9090/mapi/tenants/finance/namespaces ?filterType=name&filterString=accounts&prettyprint"

These considerations apply to filtering resource lists:

The filterType and filterString parameters are valid only with the namespaces, userAccounts, and dataAccessPermissions resources. If a GET request includes the filterType parameter but does not include the filterString parameter, HCP returns the complete list of items of the applicable type. You can page, sort, and filter resource lists in the same request. Replication resources

Replication resources let you configure, monitor, and manage replication. The table below provides information about these resources.
