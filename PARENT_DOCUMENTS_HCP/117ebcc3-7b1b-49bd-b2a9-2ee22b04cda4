                       <b>Title:</b> In the response to a client request, HCP includes a cookie that contains encoded session information.
HCP supports two formats for encoding the session cookie:
RFC2109
HCP used only this format in releases 5.0 and earlier.
RFC6265
HCP has used this format by default in all releases since 5.0.
You can use the request header to specify the format HCP should use to encode the session cookie. Valid values for this header are RFC2109 and X-HCP-CookieCompatibility
RFC6265.
The header is: X-HCP-CookieCompatibility
Optional and typically not used for RFC6265
Required for RFC2109
