Description

503

Service Unavailable

Possible reasons include:

The request contains the nowait query parameter, and HCP determined that the request would have taken a significant amount of time to return the object.

HCP is temporarily unable to handle the request, probably due to system overload, maintenance, or upgrade.

Try the request again, gradually increasing the delay between each successive attempt. If the error

persists, contact your tenant administrator.

Example: Retrieving all object data

Hereâ€™s a sample HTTP GET request that retrieves an object named Q1_2012.ppt in the quarterly_rpts directory. Request with curl command line

curl -k -H "Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d"

"https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/rest/quarterly_rpts/Q1_2012.ppt" > Q1_2012.ppt

Tip: If a GET request unexpectedly returns a zero-length file, use the -i parameter with curl to return the response headers in the target file. These headers may provide helpful information for diagnosing the problem.

Request in Python using PycURL import pycurl filehandle = open("Q1_2012.ppt", 'wb')

curl = pycurl.Curl() curl.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Authorization: HCP

bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d"]) curl.setopt(pycurl.URL, "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com \

/rest/quarterly_rpts/Q1_2012.ppt") curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0) curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0) curl.setopt(pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, filehandle.write)
