Example: Retrieving an object

Here is a sample GET request that retrieves the current version of the object named mktg/campaign_GoGetEm_expenses.xls in the finance bucket. Versioning is enabled on the bucket. Because the user has data access permission on the bucket, labeled holds are returned in a JSON format string. Request with s3curl command line

./s3curl.pl --id=lgreen -- -v -k "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/mktg/campaign_GoGetEm_expenses.xls"

Example: Conditionally retrieving an object

Here is a sample GET request that retrieves the current version of the object named mktg/campaign_GoGetEm_expenses.xls in the finance bucket only if the ETag for the object does not match a specified value. In this example, the specified value is the ETag of the first version of mktg/campaign_GoGetEm_expenses.xls. The request writes the object data to a file named mktg_GoGetEm.xls. The request is being made while versioning is enabled for the bucket.
