                       <b>Title:</b> Retrieving an object or multiple versions of an object
You use the HTTP GET method to retrieve an object, a version of an object, or a range of versions of an object from a namespace. When retrieving an single object or version, you
can request all the object data or part of the data. When retrieving multiple versions of an object, you can only request all the object data.
You can use a GET request to retrieve all the object data of a single object or version and an annotation together. You cannot retrieve part of the object data together with an
annotation in a single request. You can also use a GET request to retrieve the timestamp range of an object, which you can use to find a version of that object.
Using GET with a symbolic link returns the current version of the object that is the target of the link.
Note: Attempts to retrieve the current version of a deleted object result in an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error code. However, if versioning is enabled, you can retrieve the version you
deleted by specifying its version ID.
Access permission
To retrieve an object or version, you need read permission.
Request header
GET /rest/directory/file?version=@version&deleted=true HTTP/1.1
The GET request to retrieve an object has these elements:
If you are accessing the namespace as an authenticated user, an header Authorization
The URL of the object or symbolic link<br>
