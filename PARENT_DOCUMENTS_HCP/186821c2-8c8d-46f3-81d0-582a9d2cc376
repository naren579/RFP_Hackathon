Introduction to the HCP metadata query API

The HCP metadata query API is a RESTful HTTP API that lets you query HCP for objects that meet specific criteria. In response to a query, HCP returns metadata for the matching

objects. With the metadata query API, you can query not only for objects currently in the repository but also for information about objects that have been deleted from the repository. About the metadata query API

The HCP metadata query API lets you query namespaces for objects that match criteria you specify. Query criteria can be based on system metadata, custom metadata, ACLs, and

operations performed on objects. The API does not support queries based on object content.

In response to a query, HCP returns metadata for objects that match query criteria. It does not return object data.

The metadata query API supports two types of queries, object-based queries and operation-based queries.

A single query can return metadata for objects in multiple namespaces, including a combination of HCP namespaces and the default namespace. For HCP namespaces that support versioning, operation-based queries can return metadata for both current and old versions of objects.

To support object-based queries, HCP maintains an index of objects in the repository. To access HCP through the metadata query API, you use the HTTP POST method. With this method, you specify query criteria in the request body. In the request body you also specify what information you want in the query results.

The API accepts query criteria in XML or JSON format and can return results in either format. For example, you could use XML to specify the query criteria and request that the

response be JSON.
