Recommendations for HCP back-end network switch configuration

If an HCP system is using customer-supplied and managed back-end network switches, as in the case for an HCP system hosted on VMware, and the back-end network configuration requires IGMP snooping, configure the back-end as follows:

■ Set the Querier’s IP address: The Querier’s IP address should be set to an IP

address within the subnet of the HCP back-end network. This is required for the Querier to detect and manage multicast group membership properly. Supported Fibre Channel switches
