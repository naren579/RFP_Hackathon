Example: Creating a group account

Hereâ€™s a sample PUT request that creates a group account for the Finance tenant. The account is defined in an XML file named admin-GA.xml. The name of the group account is specified in the XML file. For the request to be successful, a group with this name must already exist in AD. The request is made using a tenant-level user account that includes the security role.
