7. Click Update Password. Requests and responses

With the Hitachi API for Amazon S3, you submit requests for operations to HCP, and HCP returns responses that indicate the outcome of the request and include any requested information or content.

This section of the Help contains general information about S3 compatible requests and HCP responses to those requests. Request line

The request line for an S3 compatible request specifies the operation to be performed and the version of HTTP on which the S3 compatible API is based. Additionally:

If the target of the request is a tenant or if the target is a bucket and the hostname includes the bucket name, the request line includes a forward slash by itself.

For example, here are the request line and HOST header for a request to create a bucket named finance where the bucket name is included in the hostname: PUT / HTTP/1.1 HOST: finance.europe.hcp.example.com

If the target of the request is a bucket and the hostname does not include the bucket name, the request line includes the a forward slash followed by the bucket name.

For example, here are the request line and HOST header for a request to create a bucket named finance where the bucket name is not included in the hostname: PUT /finance HTTP/1.1 HOST: europe.hcp.example.com

If the target of the operation is an object, the request line includes a forward slash followed by the object name either by itself or following the bucket name, depending on whether the hostnames includes the bucket name.

For example, here are the request line and HOST header for a request to create an object named quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019 where the bucket name is included in the hostname: PUT /quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019 HTTP/1.1 HOST: finance.europe.hcp.example.com

Here are the request line and HOST header for a request to create an object named quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019 in a bucket named finance where the bucket name is not included in the hostname:

PUT /finance/quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019 HTTP/1.1 HOST: europe.hcp.example.com

If the request uses any query parameters, those parameters are appended to the last one of the items listed above.

For example, here are the request line and HOST header for a request to add an ACL to an object named quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019 where the bucket name is included in the hostname:

PUT /quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019?acl HTTP/1.1 HOST: finance.europe.hcp.example.com

If the request includes invalid query parameters, those parameters are ignored.

Common request headers

Some request headers are common to all S3 compatible API requests. The list below describes those headers. Request headers that are specific to certain requests are described in the sections for those requests.

Request header names are not case sensitive. Depending on the header, the header values may be case sensitive. Authorization

Specifies user credentials or requests anonymous access.

Date

Specifies the date and time when the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. The date and time must always be specified using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To specify the date and time, use this format: DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

In this format:

DDD

The three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Mon).

dd

The two-digit day of the month.

MMM
