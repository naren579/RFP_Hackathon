                       <b>Title:</b> You can specify each IP address list entry in the Allow and Deny lists in one of the following formats:
A single IP address
A range of IPv4 addresses specified as ip-address/subnet-mask (for example, 192.168.100.197/255.255.255.0) or in CIDR format (for example, 192.168.100.0/24)
A range of IPv6 addresses specified in CIDR format (for example, 2001:0db8::/32)
The CIDR entry that matches all IPv4 addresses is 0.0.0.0/0. The CIDR entry that matches all IPv6 addresses is 0::0/0.
IP address list handling
IP addresses can be included in one, both, or neither of the Allow and Deny lists. To specify how HCP should handle access requests from IP addresses that are either included in
both lists or excluded from both lists, select or clear the Allow request when same IP address is used in both lists option. The following table describes the effects of selecting and
clearing this option.<br>
