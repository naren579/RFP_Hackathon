. . . ethtool

The ethtool command displays information about the NIC parameters and device drivers for both front-end interfaces. You might run this command, for example, to diagnose issues with 10 gigabyte Ethernet network configurations.

To execute the ethtool command:

1. From the Appliance Diagnostics menu, enter 6.

The results of the ethtool command are displayed on the screen.

2. After viewing the display, press Enter to return to the Appliance Diagnostics menu.

Working with HCP internal logs

In addition to the HCP system log, which is displayed in the System Management Console, HCP maintains internal logs. These logs record the processing activity of various components of the HCP system. If a problem with the system occurs, the internal logs can help HCP support personnel diagnose and resolve it.

Internal logs can be generated for both HCP General Nodes and HCP HCP S Series Nodes. The logs can be created separately for the two types of nodes or together. There are four different types of logs. Each is responsible for capturing information about a different component of the HCP system. If you request logs for S Series Nodes, you get all of the S Series Node logs regardless of whether you selected specific log types for the HCP system.

At any time, you can insert a comment into the internal logs. You can use this capability, for example, to note unusual events that occur in the HCP system. This can later help support personnel understand the symptoms that indicate a possible problem. It can also help them determine when a problem started.

To help with troubleshooting, you can download the internal logs and send them to your HCP support center. For ease of handling, HCP downloads the logs into a single file.

HCP keeps internal logs for at most 90 days. You can download the logs for any length of time within that period. When taking this action, be sure to include all the days on which you observed problems with the system. When downloading the logs, you can provide a message for the support center. This message should include a description of the problem, your contact information, the applicable case number (if one has been assigned), and any other information that can help support personnel resolve the problem.

Encryption for logs is disabled by default. In order to enable encryption contact your HCP support provider. If encryption is enabled, only HCP support personnel have the key required to decrypt the logs.

Important: Downloading the internal logs puts a heavy load on the HCP system. Do not take this action unless explicitly told to do so by HCP support personnel.
