deleteDays

Integer

Specifies the number of days objects flagged as replication collisions must remain in the namespace before they are automatically deleted. Valid values are integers in the range zero through 36,500

This property is required on a POST request when the value of the deleteEnab led property is true. It is invalid on a POST request when the value of the deleteEnabled property is false.

(that is, 100 years). A value of zero means delete immediately.

deleteEnabled Boolean

Specifies whether HCP should automatically delete objects flagged as replication collisions. Valid values are:

true

Automatically delete objects flagged as replication collisions after the number of days specified by the deleteDays property.

false

Do not automatically delete objects flagged as replication collisions. Example

Hereâ€™s an XML example of the replicationCollisionSettings data type property:

<replicationCollisionSettings> <action>MOVE</action> <deleteDays>10</deleteDays> <deleteEnabled>true</deleteEnabled> </replicationCollisionSettings>

replicationLink

The replicationLink property describes the replicationLinks property of the linkCandidates resource for erasure coding and the replicationLinks property of the ecTopo logy data type.

hcpSystems

List

Lists the two HCP systems included in the replication link. To specify a system, use the fully qualified name of the domain associated with the [hcp_system] network on that system.

This property is optional on a PUT request to create an erasure coding topology.

If a PUT request to create an erasure coding topology does not include the uuid property for a replication link and the name specified for the link is the same as the name of one or more other links, HCP may not know which link you want to include in the topology. To ensure that the correct link is used, the request should include the hcpSystems property for the link you want.

In XML, the element that identifies each system is name. In JSON, the name in the name/value pair that lists the systems is name. name

String

Specifies the name of the replication link.

This property is required on a PUT request to create an erasure coding topology if the request does not include the uuid property for the replication link. Otherwise, the name property is optional.

pausedTenantsCount

Integer Specifies the number of tenants for which replication on the

link is currently paused.

This property is not valid on a PUT request to create an erasure coding topology. It is returned only by a verbose GET request. state

String

Indicates the general health of the replication link. Possible values are:
