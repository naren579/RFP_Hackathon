Deleting a bucket

You use the HTTP DELETE method to delete a bucket. To delete a bucket, you need to be the bucket owner.

You can delete a bucket only while itâ€™s empty. If you try to delete a bucket that contains any objects, HCP returns a 409 (Conflict) status code and does not delete the bucket. Request line

Depending on whether the bucket name is included in the hostname in the S3 compatible request, a request to delete a bucket has either of these formats:

With the bucket name included in the hostname:

DELETE / HTTP/1.1

With the bucket name following the hostname:

DELETE /bucket-name HTTP/1.1
