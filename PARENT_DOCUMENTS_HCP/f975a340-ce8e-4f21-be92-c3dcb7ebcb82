Example: Listing statistics for a namespace

Hereâ€™s a sample HTTP GET request that retrieves statistics for the finance namespace owned by the europe tenant in the hcp.example.com system. Request with curl command line

curl -k -H "Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d" "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/proc/statistics"

Request in Python using PycURL

import pycurl curl = pycurl.Curl()

curl.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d"])

curl.setopt(pycurl.URL, "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com \ /proc/statistics") curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0)

curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0) curl.perform()

print curl.getinfo(pycurl.RESPONSE_CODE) curl.close()

/> REST API usage considerations

Data chunking with write operations

In some cases, the size of the data to be stored cannot be known at the start of a REST API PUT request. For example, the size is unknown if data is dynamically generated and the PUT request starts before all data is available. This scenario would occur if you do not have enough memory or disk space to stage dynamically generated data locally, so the

application streams the PUT request as the data is generated.

In such cases, you can send the data using chunked HTTP transfer coding. Each chunk is sent with a known size, except for the last chunk, which is sent with a size of 0 (zero).

If possible, you should avoid chunking data because it increases the overhead required for the PUT operation.

Using the REST API with objects open for write

These considerations apply to using the REST API with an object that is open for write:

If the namespace supports versioning, HCP creates a new version of the object.

If the namespace does not support versioning, HCP returns an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error code and does not perform the operation.

If you try to retrieve, check the existence of, or copy the object:

If the namespace supports versioning:

If the request does not specify a version ID and the object has one or more old versions, HCP performs the requested operation against the most recent version that is not open for write. However, if that version is a delete marker, HCP returns an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error code and does not perform the
