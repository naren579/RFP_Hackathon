In response to a request to check the existence of an object or folder, HCP returns a 200 (OK) status code if the object or folder exists and a 404 (Not Found) status code if the object or folder does not exist. If you do not have read permission for the bucket or object, HCP returns a 403 (Forbidden) status code. Request line

Depending on whether the bucket name is included in the hostname in the S3 compatible request, a request to check the existence of an object, object version, or folder has either of these formats:

With the bucket name included in the hostname:

HEAD /(object-name[?versionId=version-id])|(folder-name(/|%2F)) HTTP/1.1

With the bucket name following the hostname: HEAD /bucket-name/(object-name[?versionId=version-id])|(folder-name(/|%2F)) HTTP/1.1

Required headers

The next list describes the required headers to use in a request to check the existence of an object, object version, or folder.

Authorization

Specifies user credentials or requests anonymous access. Date

Specifies the date and time when the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. The date and time must always be specified using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To specify the date and time, use this format:

DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

In this format: DDD

The three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Mon).

dd

The two-digit day of the month.

MMM

The three-letter abbreviation for the month, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Feb).

yyyy

The four-digit year.

HH

The hour on a 24-hour clock. mm

The number of minutes.

ss

The number of seconds.

For example:

Thu, 23 Mar 2017 14:27:05 +0000

All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header.

Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket.

For a tenant, use this format: tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date

Specifies the date and time at which the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. For the valid values for this header, see the description of the Date header above. Optional headers

If-Match

Specifies one or more values for comparison with the ETag of the specified item. If the ETag matches one of the specified values, HCP continues processing the request. If the ETag does not match any of the specified values, HCP returns a 412 (Precondition Failed) status code. To specify the values for this header, use this format: "value"[, "value"]...

In this format, each value can be any string of one or more characters and must be enclosed in double quotation marks ("). Alternatively, you can specify a single asterisk (*) as the value for the If-Match header. All ETags match an asterisk in an If-Match header.
