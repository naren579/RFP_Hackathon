allowErasureCoding Boolean

For an HCP namespace, specifies whether HCP is allowed to use erasure coding to implement replication of the objects in the namespace. Valid values are:

This property is valid on a PUT or POST request only if the owning tenant is allowed to manage erasure coding for its namespaces.

true

This property is optional on a PUT request. false

HCP is allowed to use erasure coding for replication of the namespace.

HCP is not allowed to use erasure coding for replication of the namespace.

You can set the value of this property to true on a PUT request only if the value of the optimizedFor property is set to true in the same request or if new namespaces are cloud optimized by default.

If the tenant is allowed to manage erasure coding for namespaces, the default is the setting specified by the namespace defaults for the tenant. If the tenant does not have this ability, the default is to allow erasure coding for namespaces that are cloud optimized.

You can set the value of this property to true on a POST request only if the namespace is already cloud optimized or the optimizedFor property is set to true in the same request.

This property is not returned by any GET request for a namespace that is not selected for replication or for which the owning tenant is not allowed to manage erasure coding for its namespaces. This property is not valid for the default namespace.
