Listing the buckets you own

You use the HTTP GET method to list the buckets you own. To list the buckets you own, you must be an authenticated user.

The target of a request to list the buckets you own is a tenant (that is, the service point). The list of buckets in the response contains only buckets created in the context of that tenant and only those that have the S3 compatible API enabled. The buckets are listed in alphanumeric order.

The list of buckets you own is returned in an XML response body. Request line

An S3 compatible request to list the buckets you own has this format:

GET / HTTP/1.1

All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name
