X-HCP-Hash: hash-algorithmhash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored data is the same as the data you sent. To perform the verification, compare this value with a hash value that you generate from the original data. The

X-HCP-Hash

header is not returned for multipart objects.

X-HCP-Size
