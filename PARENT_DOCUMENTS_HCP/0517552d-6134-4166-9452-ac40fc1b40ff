If the object is on labeled hold (X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold:true) and the user has privileged data access and read permissions on the object, this header is returned with a list of all labeled holds. Example

X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold-Labels: [{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-1","hold": true}, [{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-2","hold": true },[{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-3","hold": true }]

X-HCP-LastVersionId

The version ID of the last returned object version.

X-HCP-Owner

The user that owns the object.

This value is an empty string if the object has no owner. This value is nobody for objects that were stored by an authenticated user before the HCP system was upgraded from a release earlier than 5.0. These objects effectively have no owner. This value is a user account ID if HCP can no longer identify the object owner by username. For example, you would see a user account ID if the HCP user account has

been deleted. X-HCP-Replicated

A true or false value indicating whether the object, has been replicated. The value is true only if the current version of the object, its system metadata, annotations (if any), and ACL (if any) have been replicated.

HCP returns this header only if either of these conditions is true:

HCP is configured to return this header, and the request does not include the X-HCP-Get-Replicated header with a value of false. The request includes the X-HCP-Get-Replicated header with a value of true. X-HCP-ReplicationCollision

A true or false value indicating whether the object is flagged as a replication collision.

X-HCP-Retention

The end of the retention period for the object. Possible values are:

A time in seconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC

0

1 -2

X-HCP-RetentionClass

The name of the retention class to which the object belongs.

This value is an empty string if the object is not in a retention class. X-HCP-RetentionHold

A true or false value indicating whether the object is on hold.

X-HCP-RetentionString

The end of the retention period for the object. Possible values are:

A date and time in this format:

yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, Z represents the offset from UTC and is specified as:

(+|-)hhmm

For example, 2019-12-14T14:27:20-0500 represents the start of the 20th second into 2:27 PM, December 14, 2019, EST. Deletion Allowed Deletion Prohibited

Initial Unspecified

X-HCP-Shred

A true or false value indicating whether HCP will shred the object after the object is deleted.

X-HCP-Size

The size of the object data, in bytes.

X-HCP-SoftwareVersion

The version number of the HCP software.

X-HCP-SymlinkTarget

The path to the target object as specified when the symbolic link was created. This header is returned only if the URL specifies a symbolic link to an object. If this header is returned, the X-HCP-ACL value is always false. X-HCP-Type

The object entity type.

X-HCP-UID

The POSIX user ID for the object.

For objects added through the NFS protocol, this value is determined by the NFS client. This value is an empty string if either of these conditions are true:

The object was added through a protocol other than NFS and neither the UID nor the GID for the object was changed.

The HCP product-specific owner of the object was changed. X-HCP-VersionId

The version ID of the object.

Response headers for retrieving a range of object versions

The next list describes request-specific response headers for retrieving a range of object versions from a namespace.

When retrieving multiple versions of an object, you can only request all the object data. Four headers are returned for each object version, as described in the following list.

X-HCP-VersionID
