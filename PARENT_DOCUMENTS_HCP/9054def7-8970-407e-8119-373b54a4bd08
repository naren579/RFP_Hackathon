Content Platform System Management Help Access control lists

An access control list grants permissions for individual objects to specified users or groups of users. ACLs are specified in XML format.

An ACL contains up to one thousand access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE specifies one user or one group of users and the permissions granted to that user or group. In the ACL body, an ACE is represented by the grant element.

The permissions you grant to users and groups in an ACL must be equal to or less than your permissions for the object. You cannot use an ACL to grant a permission that you donâ€™t

already have. ACL permissions

The following list lists the permissions you can grant through an ACL along with the operations they let you perform.

Read

Retrieve objects and system metadata Check for and retrieve custom metadata

Read_ACL

Check for and retrieve ACLs

Write

Add objects Create directories

Set and change system and custom metadata Write_ACL

Set and change ACLs

Delete

Delete objects, empty directories, custom metadata, and ACLs

XML format

<?xml version="1.0" ?>

<accessControlList> <grant>

<grantee>

<type>(user|group)</type> <name>(hcp-username| active-directory-username| active-directory-group-name|
