Allow list handling for NFS

For NFS, if the Allow list in the NFS panel includes one or more IP addresses, those addresses have access to the namespace through NFS and all others donâ€™t. If the list is empty, all IP addresses can access the namespace through NFS.

Allow and Deny list handling for SMTP

For SMTP, HCP handles Allow and Deny list entries as described in the table below.

The REST, S3 compatible, and CIFS protocols have the option to either require user authentication or support both authenticated and unauthenticated (anonymous) access. If a protocol requires authentication, users must present valid credentials in order to use the protocol. If a protocol supports both types of access, users can present credentials but are not required to.

With the REST, S3 compatible, or CIFS protocol configured to support both authenticated and anonymous access:

If a user presents credentials, HCP tries to authenticate the user. If the credentials are valid, HCP continues processing the request. If the credentials are invalid, HCP rejects the request. With REST and CIFS, if a user does not present credentials, HCP continues processing the request.

Configuring the REST, S3 compatible, and WebDAV APIs

With the REST and S3 compatible APIs, users and applications can add, view, and delete objects and modify object metadata through a RESTful API. With the WebDAV API, users and applications can perform these activities through familiar directory structures. REST, S3 compatible, and WebDav API configuration
