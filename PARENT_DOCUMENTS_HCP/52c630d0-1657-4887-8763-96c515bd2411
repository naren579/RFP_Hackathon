For example:

Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:27:05 GMT Transfer-Encoding

Always chunked. This header is returned if the response includes a response body but HCP cannot determine the size of the response body before formulating the response. Because HCP returns error information in a response body, the response to any request can include a Transfer-Encoding header.

Some common response headers address browser security concerns. These headers have fixed values. The table below describes these headers. Cache-Control

Specifies directives that must be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain Values: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate

Content-Security-Policy

Restricts the content that the browser can load to the sources specified by the header value Values: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; Expires

Causes the response to become stale immediately after it is sent Value: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT

Pragma

Prevents the response from being used for subsequent requests for the same resource without the browser first checking whether the resource has changed Value: no-cache X-Content-Type-Options

Prevents the browser from examining the returned content to determine the content MIME type Value: nosniff

X-DNS-Prefetch-Control

Prevents the browser from performing domain name resolution on URLs embedded in returned content before the URLs are requested Value: off

X-Download-Options

Prevents the browser from opening resources that are downloaded through links in the returned content Value: noopen X-Frame-Options

Prevents the browser from rendering the returned content in a frame on a page containing content not returned by the HCP system

X-XSS-Protection

Stops the browser from loading the returned content if the browser detects reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the response Values: 1; mode=block

For information about request-specific response headers, see the "Response header" topic for each type of operation you can perform with the S3 compatible API. Note:

HCP can also return several standard HTTP response headers that are not described in this book. Among others, these include Connection, Content-Disposition, Conte nt-Encoding, and Content-Language. For more information about HTTP response headers, see the HTTP/1.1 standards (RFCs 7230 through 7237). The Cache-Control and Expires headers are not returned with error responses. Error response body

When an S3 compatible request results in an error, HCP returns information about the error in an error request body. An error request body contains XML in this format:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Error> <Code>error-code</Code> <Message>error-message</Message> <RequestId>request-id</RequestId> <HostId>host-id</HostId> <BucketName>specified-bucket-name</BucketName> <Key>object-name</Key> </Error>

The list below describes XML elements in an error response body.

Error

Root element.

Code

The error code.

Message

Text that provides more information about the error.

RequestId

The HCP-internal ID assigned to the request. HostId

The HCP-internal ID of the host responding to the request.

BucketName

The specified bucket name. This element is included in the response body only when the error code is NoSuchBucket.

Key

The specified object name. This element is included in the response body only when the error code is NoSuchKey. Error codes

Every error response body contains an error code and a message that provides more information about the error. Error codes are returned in addition to HTTP status codes. A single HTTP status code can correspond to multiple error codes.

The table below describes the error codes that can be returned in response to S3 compatible API requests.
