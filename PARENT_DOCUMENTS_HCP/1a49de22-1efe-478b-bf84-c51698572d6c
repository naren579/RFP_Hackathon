One of the systems involved in an active/active link The primary system for an active/passive link The replica for an active/passive link

This section of the Help describes the basic workflows for these scenarios.

System failure workflow with an active/active link

The table below outlines what happens when one of the systems involved in an active/active link fails, where the system that fails is system A and the system that remains healthy is system B. Step

What you do

What happens

System A fails

1

On system B, fail over the link

If DNS failover is enabled, system B broadcasts new DNS configuration

2

If DNS failover is disabled, direct clients to write only to system B

System A comes back online

3

If system A has been rebuilt:

On system A, upload the replication SSL server certificate from system B On system B, upload the replication SSL server certificate from system A

4

On system B, update the link configuration as needed

5

If the link is broken, on system B, send a request to restore the link

Replication link is recreated

6

On system B, fail back the link

System A and system B broadcast original DNS configurations; replication restarts in both directions on the link Primary system failure workflow

The table below outlines what happens when the primary system for an active/passive link fails.

Step

What you do

What happens

Primary system fails

1 On the replica, fail over the link

Applicable tenants and directories on the replica become read-write; applicable tenants and directories on the primary system either remain read-write or become read-only depending on whether the two systems can communicate with each other; if DNS failover is enabled, the replica broadcasts new DNS configuration

2

If DNS failover is disabled, direct clients to write only to the replica

Primary system comes back online

3

If the primary system has been rebuilt:

On the primary system, upload the replication SSL server certificate from the replica On the replica, upload the replication SSL server certificate from the primary system

4

On the replica, update the link configuration as needed

5

If the link is broken, on the replica, send a request to restore the link

Replication link is recreated

6

On the replica, begin data recovery Applicable tenants and directories on the replica remain read-write; applicable tenants and directories on the primary system remain or become read-only; data recovery from the replica to the primary system begins

7

Wait for data recovery to come close to being up to date

8

On the replica, complete data recovery

Applicable tenants and directories on the replica become read-only; applicable tenants and directories on the primary system remain read-only; data recovery from the replica to the primary system continues to completion Data recovery finishes

9

Nothing

Applicable tenants and directories on the replica remain read-only; applicable tenants and directories on the primary system become read- write; the primary system and the replica broadcast original DNS

configurations; replication from the primary system to the replica restarts

10

If DNS failover is disabled, after you see this message in the system log, direct clients to write only to the primary system: Replication data recovery completed Replica failure workflow

The table below outlines what happens when the replica for an active/passive link fails.

Step

What you do

What happens

Replica fails

1

On the primary system, suspend activity on the link

Replica comes back online

2

If the replica has been rebuilt:

On the replica, upload the replication SSL server certificate from the primary system On the primary system, upload the replication SSL server certificate from the replica

3

On the primary system, update the link configuration as needed

4

If the link is broken, on the primary system, send a request to restore the link

Replication link is recreated; applicable tenants and directories on the primary system remain read-write; applicable tenants and directories on the replica are read-only
