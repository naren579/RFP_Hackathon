Description

200

OK

Possible reasons include:

HCP successfully started processing the request.

To determine whether the multipart upload successfully completed, check whether HCP returned a response body that identifies the resulting multipart object or an error response body.

The following errors can cause a request to complete a multipart upload to fail after HCP returns the 200 (OK) status code:

The list of parts in the request body includes a part, other than the last part, that is smaller than one megabyte. The list of parts in the request body includes one or more part numbers that are not the number of an uploaded part. The ETag associated with one or more part numbers listed in the request body is not the ETag returned for the part with the specified part number. The parts in the request body are not listed in ascending order. The request includes the If-Match request header and either the value specified by the header does not match the ETag of the most recent version of the specified object, or the specified object does not already exist.

The application attempts to set a labeled hold on an object with an HCP version earlier than 9.1.
