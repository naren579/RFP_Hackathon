When you enable WebDAV basic authentication, you need to specify a username and password. In this case, you use the webdavBasicAuthPassword property of the httpProtoco l data type to specify the password.

Passwords can be up to 64 characters long, are case sensitive, and can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, including white space. To be valid, a password must include at least one character from two of these three groups: alphabetic, numeric, and other. The minimum password length is configurable. To set the minimum password length, you use the minimumPasswordLength property of the consoleSecurity data type.

Descriptions

Namespaces, namespace defaults, retention classes, user accounts, replication links, and erasure coding topologies all have a description property. Tenants have two properties for descriptions — systemVisibleDescription and tenantVisibleDescription.

All descriptions can be up to 1,024 characters long and can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, including white space.

All description properties are optional. If you omit this property when you create a namespace, the description defaults to the description specified by the namespace defaults for the tenant. For other resources, the default on creation is no description. Boolean values

For properties that take a Boolean value, valid values are:

true, t, or 1 (one) false, f, or 0 (zero)

These values are case sensitive.

Invalid values are interpreted as false. Permission lists

These resources and properties have values that are lists of permissions:

The permissions resource for tenants (specifies the permissions in the data access permission mask for a tenant) The permissions resource for namespaces (specifies the permissions in the data access permission mask for a namespace) The permissions property of the namespacePermission data type (used in the specification of the data access permissions for a user or group account) The authMinimumPermissions and authAndAnonymousMinimum-Permissions properties of the namespaces data type

The permissions that can be included in a list differ for the various resources and properties. However, in each case:

In XML, the element that identifies each permission is permission. For example:

<permissions> <permission>READ</permission> <permission>WRITE</permission> <permission>DELETE</permission> <permission>PURGE</permission> <permission>SEARCH</permission> </permissions> In JSON, the name in the name/value pair that lists the permissions is permission. For example:

"permissions" : { "permission" : [ "READ", "WRITE", "DELETE", "PURGE", "SEARCH" ] }

availableServicePlan

The availableServicePlan data type describes the availableServicePlans resource for tenants.

The certificate data type retrieves information about current and past replication certificates.
