Example: Retrieving a list of retention classes

Hereâ€™s a sample GET request that retrieves a list of the retention classes defined for the Accounts-Receivable namespace. The request writes the list of retention classes to a file named AR-retclasses.xml. The request is made using a tenant-level user account that includes the compliance role. Request with cURL command line
