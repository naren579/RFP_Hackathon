You can configure HCP to work with SNMP. With SNMP enabled, you can have HCP send system log messages to one or more specified SNMP managers. When you do this, you can use tools in your SNMP environment to perform functions such as sorting the messages, querying for certain events, or forwarding error messages to a mobile device.
