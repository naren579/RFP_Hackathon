Integer

Specifies the port on which the local system for the replication link listens for data from the remote system. The default is 5748.

Typically, you specify a different port only if other port usage makes it necessary.

remoteHost String

Identifies the remote system for the replication link. Valid values are: The domain name of the remote system, in either of these formats:

replication.hcp-domain- name replication.admin. hcp-domain-name

hcp-domain-name must be the name of the domain associated with the network that’s selected for replication on the remote system. The second format is required if the domain for the replication network is shared with other networks.

One or more comma-separated IP addresses of storage nodes in the remote system. These must be the node IP addresses in the network that’s selected for replication on the remote system.

The local system for the link transmits data only to the nodes identified by the domain name or IP addresses you specify. Therefore, you should specify IP addresses only if you have a compelling reason to do so (for example, HCP is not using DNS, or you need to reduce the processing load on some number of nodes). remotePort

Integer

Specifies the port on which the remote system for the replication link listens for data from the local system. The default is 5748.

Typically, you specify a different port only if other port usage makes it necessary.

Example

Here’s an XML example of the connection data type:

<connection> <localHost> 192.168.210.16, 192.168.210.17, 192.168.210.18, 192.168.210.19 </localHost> <localPort>5748</localPort> <remoteHost>replication.admin.hcp-ca.example.com</remoteHost> <remotePort>5748</remotePort> </connection> consoleSecurity

The consoleSecurity data type describes the consoleSecurity resource for tenants.

coolDownPeriodDuration

Integer

Specifies the amount of time an HCP user account can remain locked due to failed login attempts. Valid values are integers in the range zero through 999. A value of zero means accounts are never automatically unlocked. The default is 5 seconds. coolDownPeriodSettings

boolean

Specifies whether the cool down period setting is active. True if the setting is active; otherwise, False.

disableAfterAttempts

Integer

Specifies the number of times a locally authenticated

If the last locally authenticated user account with the security role is disabled due to failed login attempts and no group accounts have the security role, the user account is reenabled automatically after one hour.

A value of zero means accounts are never disabled due to failed login attempts. disableAfterInactiveDays

Integer

Specifies the number of days an HCP user account
