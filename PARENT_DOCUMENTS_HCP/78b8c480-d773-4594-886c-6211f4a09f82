When mapping or adding the namespace, you can use either the domain name of the HCP system or the IP address of a node in the system. Here are the supported formats: \\cifs.hcp-domain-name\tenant-name_namespace-name[\data|metadata]

\\namespace-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name \tenant-name_namespace-name[\data|metadata]

\\node-ip-address\tenant-name_namespace-name[\data|metadata]

Examples:

\\cifs.hcp.example.com\europe_finance

\\cifs.hcp.example.com\europe_finance\data\presentations \\cifs.hcp.example.com\europe_finance\metadata

\\finance.europe.hcp.example.com\europe_finance\data

\\192.168.210.16\europe_finance\data\presentations\images

Content Platform System Management Help

Note: When logged in to a CIFS client as an AD user, you can see all the namespaces and directories that have been mapped to network drives or added as network places. However, you can take action only in those namespaces for which you have permissions. CIFS return codes

The list below describes the possible return codes for CIFS requests against a namespace.

NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

The requested operation is not allowed. Reasons for this return code include attempts to:

Rename an object Rename a directory that contains one or more objects

Overwrite an object Modify the content of an object

Delete an object thatâ€™s under retention Delete a directory that contains one or more objects

Add a file (other than a file containing custom metadata), directory, or symbolic link anywhere in the metadata structure Delete a metafile or metadirectory

Create a hard link NT_STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR

The requested operation would shorten the retention period of the specified object, which is not allowed.

NT_STATUS_RETRY

HCP tried to read the requested object from another system in the replication topology, and the data either could not be read or was not yet available. CIFS examples

The following sections show examples of using CIFS to access a namespace. Each example shows both a Windows command and Python code that implements the same command.

These examples assume that the data directory is mapped to the X: drive and the metadata metadirectory is mapped to the Y: drive.

Example: Storing an object

This example stores an object named wind.jpg in the existing images directory by copying a file of the same name from the local file system.

Windows command copy wind.jpg x:\images

Python code

import shutil shutil.copy("wind.jpg", "x:\\images\\wind.jpg")

Example: Changing a retention setting

This example extends the retention period for the wind.jpg object by one year. If this object is still open due to lazy close, changing the retention setting closes it.

Windows command echo +1y > y:\images\wind.jpg\retention.txt

Python code

retention_value = "+1y" retention_fh = file("y:\\images\\wind.jpg\\retention.txt")

try: retention_fh.write(retention_value)

finally: retention_fh.close()

Example: Retrieving an object

This example retrieves the object named wind.jpg from the namespace and stores the resulting file with the same name in the existing RetrievedFiles directory.

Windows command copy x:\images\wind.jpg RetrievedFiles

Python code

import shutil shutil.copy("x:\\images\\wind.jpg", "RetrievedFiles\\wind.jpg") CIFS usage considerations

This chapter presents considerations that affect the use of the CIFS protocol for namespace access.
