3 Chargeback page graphs

The Chargeback page contains four graphs. These graphs show information about the usage of the tenant's namespaces during the past 30 days (or since HCP was installed if that was less than 30 days ago).

The graphs are:

Writes (bytes)

Shows the number of bytes of data written to the tenant's namespaces. The number of bytes written includes all parts written for multipart uploads regardless of whether the upload of the part has finished, the part was subsequently replaced, the multipart upload was aborted, or the part was not used in the completed multipart upload. Writes (operations)

Shows the number of successful write operations that targeted the tenant's namespaces. Each write of a part for a multipart upload counts as a separate write operation. This applies even if the part was subsequently replaced, the multipart upload was aborted, or the part was not used in the completed multipart upload. Reads (bytes)

Shows the number of bytes of data read from the tenant's namespaces.

Reads (operations)

Shows the number of read operations that targeted the tenant's namespaces. A read of a multipart object counts as a single read operation.

Managing namespaces

When a tenant is first created, it has no namespaces. You use the Tenant Management Console to create them as needed.

After creating a namespace, you can view all the available information about it, change its properties, and monitor its activity. You can also delete namespaces that have no objects in them. About the Namespaces page

o view, create, and manage namespaces, you use the Namespaces page in the Tenant Management Console. To display this page, in the top-level menu, click Namespaces.

The Create Namespace bar on the Namespaces page shows the number of bytes of storage used in all the tenant's namespaces, along with a graphical representation of the

amount of storage used out of the hard quota for the tenant. It also shows the number of bytes of storage available for storing more objects in the tenant's namespaces.

The Namespaces page also lists the namespaces owned by the current tenant.

Roles: To view the Namespaces page, you need the monitor, administrator, or compliance role.

Understanding the namespace list The Namespaces page contains a list of the namespaces owned by the current tenant. For each namespace, the list shows:

The namespace name. The number of objects currently in the namespace. Each version of an object counts as a separate object. However, the object count does not include object versions that

are delete markers or delete records.

Each multipart object counts as a single object. Objects that are in the process of being created by multipart uploads are not included in the object count.
