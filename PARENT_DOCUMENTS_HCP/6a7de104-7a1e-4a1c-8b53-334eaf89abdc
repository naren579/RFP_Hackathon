When upgrading to HCP 9.4 version or later from previous HCP versions that are configured with Active Directory (AD), the sAMAccountName attribute value of the HCP computer account does not comply with Microsoft requirements (that is, the attribute value is expected to end with $ symbol at the end; however, currently it is present at the beginning of the attribute value). The sAMAccountName attribute value does comply with Microsoft requirements on newly installed HCP 9.4 clusters. To comply with the Microsoft requirement on upgraded clusters, customers need to disconnect their HCP system from AD and then reconnect; this process will update the sAMAccountName attribute value to comply with the requirement.

Standard ERROR for 'dmsetup remove --force archive001-crypt':

device-mapper: remove ioctl on archive001-

crypt failed: Device or resource busy
