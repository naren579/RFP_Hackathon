credentials, HCP responds with a 403 (Forbidden) error message.

To provide credentials in a metadata query API request, you specify an authentication token in an HTTP Authorization request header. HCP also accepts credentials provided in an hcp-ns-auth cookie. However, this method of providing credentials is being deprecated and should not be used in new applications.

HCP authentication through the metadata query management API

To authenticate with HCP through the metadata query management API, you need to construct an authentication token from a system-level user account or a tenant-level user account and then submit it using a request header with all requests. Successful authentication requires encoding your account information.

Authentication token

An authentication token consists of a username in Base64-encoded format and a password that’s hashed using the MD5 hash algorithm, separated by a colon, like this: base64-encoded-user-name:md5-hashed-password

For example, here’s the token for the Base64-encoded user name lgreen and the MD5-hashed password p4ssw0rd: bGdyZWVu:2a9d119df47ff993b662a8ef36f9ea20

The GNU Core Utilities include the base64 and md5sum commands necessary to encode your account information. These commands convert text to Base64-encoded and MD5-

hashed values, respectively. For more information about the GNU Core Utilities, see http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/.

Other tools that generate Base64-encoded and MD5-hashed values are available for download on the web. For security reasons, do not use interactive public web-based tools to generate these values.

The GNU Core Utilities include the base64 and md5sum commands, which convert text to Base64-encoded and MD5-hashed values, respectively. With these commands, a line such as this creates the required token:

echo `echo -n username | base64`:`echo -n password | md5sum` | awk

'{print $1}'

The character before echo, before and after the colon, and following md5sum is a backtick (or grave accent). The -n option in the echo command prevents the command from appending a new line to the output. This is required to ensure correct Base64 and MD5 values.

Authorization header

You use the HTTP Authorization request header to provide the authentication token for an HCP management API request. The value of this header is HCP followed by the authentication token, in this format: Authorization: HCP authentication-token

For example, here’s the Authorization header for a user named lgreen and password p4ssw0rd:

Authorization: HCP bGdyZWVu:2a9d119df47ff993b662a8ef36f9ea20

Specifying the Authorization header with cURL

With cURL, you use the -H option to specify a header. So, for example, a request to list the tenants for the HCP system named hcp.example.com might look like this: curl -k -i -H "Authorization: HCP bGdyZWVu:2a9d119df47ff993b662a8ef36f9ea20" -H "Accept: application/xml"

"https://admin.hcp.example.com:9090/mapi/tenants"

Specifying the authentication header in Python with PycURL

In Python with PycURL, you use the HTTPHEADER option to specify a header, as in this example: curl.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Authorization: HCP

bGdyZWVu:2a9d119df47ff993b662a8ef36f9ea20"])

Active Directory user authentication through the metadata query management API

To authenticate with HCP with Active Directory, you need to construct an authentication token from a AD user account and then submit it using a request header with all requests.

The username and password does not need to be encoded. Active Directory authentication token
