Working with buckets

With the Hitachi API for Amazon S3, you can perform operations on individual buckets. You can also list all the buckets you own.

Note: To perform these bucket activities, the management API must be enabled for the owning tenant:

Creating a bucket You use the HTTP PUT method to create a bucket. To create a bucket, you must be an authenticated user. Additionally, your user account must be configured to let you create buckets.

When you create a bucket, you specify a name for it. The specified name must be at least three characters long and at most 63 characters long. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-) but cannot start or end with a hyphen.
