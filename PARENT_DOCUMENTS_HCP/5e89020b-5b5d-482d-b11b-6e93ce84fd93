If the storage represented by an HCP S Series storage pool is not used to store objects in any namespaces defined on the HCP system, you can delete the storage pool.

In contrast, if the storage represented by an HCP S Series storage pool is used to store object data, you must first retire the storage pool by migrating all the data to another location.

1. In the System Management Console, click Storage > Pools. The Storage Pools page opens.

2. Click the delete control beside the unused storage pool that you want to delete.

The Confirm: Delete dialog box opens.

3. Click Delete.

Working with extended storage pools

HCP uses extended storage pools to represent logical groups of storage components that can be used as storage tiers.

Each extended storage pool consists of one or more extended storage components that are used to access the same type of storage. A storage pool contains one or more extended storage component access points (mount points, buckets, or containers). Each storage tier that is defined for a namespace by its service plan typically consists of only one storage pool; however, a tier can be configured to use multiple storage pools. To store objects on an extended storage tier, HCP uses all of the storage that is allocated to all of the extended storage component access points (mount points, buckets, or containers) that are contained in the storage pools that are configured for the storage tier. Therefore, the capacity of a given extended storage pool is the total amount of space that can be

accessed using the extended storage component access points included in the pool. You can add access points to an extended storage pool at any time, thereby increasing the capacity of the pool. Each extended storage component provides HCP with the information it needs to use one or more mount points, buckets, or containers to access and use the storage thatâ€™s represented by that extended storage component. However, HCP can actually use the storage that is represented by a given extended storage component only if at least one of its

access points is contained in a storage pool that is included in at least one storage tier that is defined for a namespace by its service plan.

Content Platform System Management Help Each time you use the Storage page to access the Create Pool wizard, you are prompted to select the type of extended storage pool that you want to create. The System Management Console then dynamically builds the pages in the Create Pool wizard to present only the fields you need to use to configure HCP to access and use the specified type of extended storage pool.

1. On the left side of the Storage page, click the Pools tab. 2. On the Pools panel, click Create Pool. The Get Started wizard opens.
