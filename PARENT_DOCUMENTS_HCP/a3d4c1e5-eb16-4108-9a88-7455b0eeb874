Each hosts file entry you create for access to a tenant must include:

An IP address of a node in the HCP system The FQDN of the tenant domain

For example, if the tenant domain name is finance.hcp.example.com and one of the HCP nodes has the IPv4 address 192.168.210.16 and the IPv6 address 2001:0db8::101, you could add either or both of these lines to the hosts file on the client: 192.168.210.16 finance.hcp.example.com 2001:0db8::101 finance.hcp.example.com

You can include comments in a hosts file either on separate lines or following a mapping on the same line. Each comment must start with a number sign (#). Blank lines are ignored.

Hostname mapping considerations

In the hosts file, you can map IP addresses for any number of nodes to a single domain name. The way a client uses multiple IP address mappings for a single domain name depends on the client platform. For information about how your client handles hosts file entries that define multiple IP address mappings for a single domain name, see your client documentation.

If any of the HCP nodes listed in the hosts file are unavailable, timeouts may occur when you use a hosts file to access the system through the management API.

Sample hosts file

Here’s a sample hosts file that contains mappings for the Finance tenant for nodes with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses: 192.168.210.16 finance.hcp.example.com 192.168.210.17 finance.hcp.example.com 192.168.210.18 finance.hcp.example.com 192.168.210.19 finance.hcp.example.com 2001:0db8::101 finance.hcp.example.com 2001:0db8::102 finance.hcp.example.com 2001:0db8::103 finance.hcp.example.com 2001:0db8::104 finance.hcp.example.com URL considerations

The following considerations apply to URLs in management API requests.

URL length

The portion of a URL that follows mapi, excluding any appended query parameters, is limited to 4,095 bytes. If a request includes a URL that violates that limit, HCP returns a status code of 414 (Request URI Too Large). Percent-encoding for special characters

Some characters have special meaning when used in a URL and may be interpreted incorrectly when used for other purposes. To avoid ambiguity, percent-encode the special characters listed in the table below.

Quotation marks with URLs in command lines

When using the HCP management API, you work in a Windows, Unix, or Mac OS X shell. Some characters in the commands you enter may have special meaning to the shell. For example, the ampersand (&) used in URLs to join multiple query parameters may indicate that a process should be put in the background.

To avoid the possibility of the Windows, Unix, or Mac OS X shell misinterpreting special characters in a URL, always enclose the entire URL in double quotation marks. Authentication

To use the HCP management API, you need either a system-level or tenant-level user account that’s defined in HCP. If HCP is configured to support Windows Active Directory® (AD), you can also use an AD user account that HCP recognizes to access HCP through the metadata query API.

HCP also accepts Active Directory authentication provided through the SPNEGO protocol or the AD authentication header. For more information about SPNEGO, see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559.
