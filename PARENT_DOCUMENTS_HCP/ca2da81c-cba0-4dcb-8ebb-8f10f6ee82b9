                       <b>Title:</b> A data access permission mask determines which of these operations are allowed in a namespace: read, write, delete, purge (delete all versions of an object), privileged delete
(delete an object that’s under retention), and search. Data access permission masks are set at the system, tenant, and namespace levels:
The system-level mask applies across all namespaces (that is, systemwide).
The tenant-level mask is set individually for each tenant. This mask applies only to the namespaces owned by that tenant.
The namespace-level mask is set individually for each namespace and applies only to that namespace.
The effective permissions for a tenant are the operations allowed by both the system-level and tenant-level permission masks. That is, to be in effect for a tenant, a permission must
be included in the system-level permission mask and in the tenant-level permission mask.
The effective permissions for a namespace are the operations that are allowed by the masks at all three levels. That is, to be in effect for a namespace, a permission must be
included in the system-level permission mask, the tenant-level permission mask, and the namespace-level permission mask.
The following table shows an example of the effective permissions for a namespace given a set of data access permission masks.<br>
