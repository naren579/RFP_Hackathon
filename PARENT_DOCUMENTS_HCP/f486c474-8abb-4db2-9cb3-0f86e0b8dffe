                       <b>Title:</b> IP addresses can be included in neither, one, or both of the Allow and Deny lists for REST, the S3 compatible API, WebDAV, CIFS, and SMTP. They can be included or not included
in the Allow list for the NFS protocol. The way HCP handles allowed and denied IP addresses differs depending on the protocol.
Allow and Deny list handling for REST, the S3 compatible API, and WebDAV
For HTTP and WebDAV, you can choose how HCP handles Allow and Deny list entries by selecting or deselecting Allow request when same IP is used in both lists in the HTTP(S)
panel. The table below describes the effects of selecting or deselecting this option. Either action takes effect immediately.<br>
