Managing the current tenant

When you log into the Tenant Management Console, you do so for a particular tenant. You can then view all the available information about that tenant, change certain of its properties, and monitor its activity. Tenant Overview page

When you log into the Tenant Management Console, the first page you see is the tenant Overview page. This page gives you a view of the tenant as a whole. It also shows the HCP system time.

To view the tenant Overview page, you need the monitor, administrator, security, or compliance role.

To return to the tenant Overview page from other Console pages, click Overview in the top-level menu. Tenant statistics

The tenant Overview page shows three categories of statistics:

Storage

This category shows:

Quota

The total number of bytes available to the tenant for allocation to its namespaces. This is the hard quota for the tenant. Used

The total number of bytes currently occupied by stored data in all the tenant's namespaces. This includes object data, metadata (except ACLs), and any redundant data required to satisfy the namespace DPLs. Used storage includes storage occupied by the parts of in-progress multipart uploads that have already been written to the tenant's namespaces. Used storage does

not include replaced parts of multipart uploads, parts uploaded for aborted multipart uploads, or unused parts of completed multipart uploads.

Used

The number of namespaces currently owned by the tenant. Available

The number of additional namespaces the tenant can own if the tenant has a quota. If the tenant has no quota, this is the number of unallocated namespaces out of the total number of namespaces the system can have, minus the number of existing namespaces owned by tenants with no quota.
