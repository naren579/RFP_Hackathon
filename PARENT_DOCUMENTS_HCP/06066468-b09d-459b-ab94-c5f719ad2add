Each line in the exports table shows a path that can be mounted by other devices. For an HCP node, the exports table includes the paths to namespaces for which the NFS protocol is enabled.

To execute the showmount command:

1. From the Appliance Diagnostics menu, enter 5. A prompt for an IP address or FQDN appears.

This command runs ‘showmount -e’ for the node you specify by address or FQDN. Please enter the address or FQDN:

2. Enter the target device IP address or FQDN. For the FQDN of the node you’re on, use localhost.

The results of the showmount command are displayed on the screen.

3. After viewing the display, press Enter to return to the Appliance Diagnostics menu. The following is a sample response to the showmount command:

Export list for 172.20.43.150: /hcp_shares/share2 172.20.43.151 /hcp_shares/share1 172.20.43.151 fchbainfo

For HCP with SAN-attached storage systems only, the fchbainfo command displays information about the logical volumes that are mapped the node you’re on for all the Fibre Channel SAN arrays to which the node is connected. You might run this command, for example, to diagnose issues with zero-copy failover.

The information displayed by the fchbainfo command is broken out by HBA port. For each logical volume that maps to the port, the display includes the volume number and size.

To execute the fchbainfo command:

1. From the Appliance Diagnostics menu, enter 6.

The results of the fchbainfo command are displayed on the screen.
