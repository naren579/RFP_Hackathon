Access and authentication

With the HCP management API, resources are represented by URLs. Each request you make must specify one such URL. Each request must also include the credentials for the account youâ€™re using to access HCP through the management API.

This section of the Help describes resource URLs and explains how to include account credentials in a management API request.

URL for HCP access through the management API

Using an IP address in URL

Normally, you let HCP choose the node on which to process a management API request. You can, however, use an IP address in the URL to access the system on a specific node. To do this, you replace the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the URL with the IP address for the node you want. If the node has both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address, you can use either address. For example, to access the namespaces resource on a node that has both the IPv4 address 192.168.210.16 and the IPv6 address 2001:0db8::101, you can use either of these URLs:
