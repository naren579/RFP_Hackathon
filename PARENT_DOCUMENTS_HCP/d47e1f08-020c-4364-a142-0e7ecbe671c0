                       <b>Title:</b> Each object in a namespace has a retention setting. Additionally, the namespace is configured with a default retention setting. When an object is stored in the namespace, the object
inherits the namespace retention setting. Using HTTP, you can override the default setting by specifying a different setting when you store the object.
Note: If the default retention setting is in the past, new objects that would otherwise get that setting are added with a setting of Deletion Allowed (0).
Every object, including objects assigned to retention classes, has a specific retention setting that specifies when (or whether) the retention period for the object ends. HCP
represents the retention setting in numeric and text formats, as shown in the following table.<br>
