Each version of an object counts as a separate object. The object count does not include object versions that are delete markers or delete records.

Each multipart object counts as a single object. Objects that are in the process of being created by multipart uploads are not included in the object count. ingestedVolume

Long

The total size of the currently stored data and custom metadata, in bytes, before it was added to the given namespace or to all the namespaces owned by the given tenant.

This is a point-in-time statistic.

storageCapacity

Used

The total number of bytes currently occupied by stored data in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant. This includes object data, metadata, and any redundant data required to satisfy the applicable service plan.

Used storage capacity also includes storage occupied by the parts of in-progress multipart uploads that have already been written to HCP. Used storage capacity does not include replaced parts of multipart uploads, parts uploaded for aborted multipart uploads, or unused parts of completed multipart uploads. bytesIn

Long

This is a dynamic statistic.

The total number of bytes successfully written to the given namespace or to all the namespaces owned by the given tenant during the reporting interval.

The total number of bytes written includes all parts uploaded for multipart uploads regardless of whether the upload of the part has finished, the part was subsequently replaced, the multipart upload was aborted, or the part was not used in the completed multipart upload.

If data was compressed before being transmitted, this is the number of bytes before compression. bytesOut

Long

This is a dynamic statistic.

The total number of bytes read from the given namespace or from all the namespaces owned by the given tenant during the reporting interval.

If data (including XML for directory listings) was compressed before being transmitted, this is the number of bytes before compression. reads

Long

Notes

A read of a multipart object counts as a single read operation. writes

Long

This is a dynamic statistic.

The total number of write operations successfully performed in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant during the reporting interval.

Each upload of a part for a multipart upload counts as a separate write operation. This applies even if the part was subsequently replaced, the multipart upload was aborted, or the part was not used in the completed multipart upload. deletes

Long

This is a dynamic statistic.

The total number of delete and purge operations performed in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant during the reporting interval.

A delete of a multipart object counts as a single delete operation. The count of delete and purge operations does note include automatic deletions of replaced parts, parts of aborted multipart uploads, or unused parts of completed multipart uploads. multipartObjects

Long

The total number of multipart objects currently stored in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant.

This is a point-in-time statistic.

mulltipartObject Parts

Long

The total number of parts of multipart objects currently stored in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant.

This is a point-in-time statistic. mulltipartObject Bytes

Long

The total number of bytes of object data in all the parts of multipart objects currently stored in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant.

This is a point-in-time statistic.

multipartUploads

Long

The total number of multipart uploads that are currently in progress in the given namespace or in all the namespaces owned by the given tenant.

This is a point-in-time statistic. multipartUpload Parts
