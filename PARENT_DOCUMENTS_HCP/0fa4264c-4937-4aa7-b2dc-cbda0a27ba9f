                       <b>Title:</b> Storing an annotation
You use the HTTP PUT method to store or replace an annotation for an existing object. Some namespaces are configured to require custom metadata to be well-formed XML. In this
case, HCP rejects an annotation that is not well-formed XML and returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error code.
An annotation is stored as a single unit. You can add it or replace it in its entirely, but you cannot add to or change an existing annotation. If you store an annotation with the same
name as an existing annotation, the new metadata replaces the existing metadata.
In addition to storing an annotation for an existing object, you can use a single request to store object data and an annotation together.
Access permission
To store an annotation, you need write permission.
Usage consideration
A PUT to store an annotation may fail in either of these cases:
The XML has a large number of different elements and attributes. In this case, the request returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error code.
To prevent failures, try restructuring the XML to have fewer different elements and attributes. For example, try concatenating multiple element values, such as the different
parts of an address, to create a new value for a single element.
If you cannot restructure the XML to prevent failures, ask your tenant administrator about reconfiguring the namespace to prevent HCP from checking custom metadata XML.
A large number of clients try to store custom metadata for multiple objects at the same time. In this case, the request returns an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error code.
To prevent failures, limit the number of concurrent requests from clients to the namespace.
