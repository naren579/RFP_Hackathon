Here's an XML example of the certificates data type:

<certificates> <certificate> <expiresOn>2021-12-12T15:35:10-0500</expiresOn> <id>server</id> <subjectDN>CN=*.example.com, OU=HCP, O=Hitachi, L=Waltham, ST=Massachusetts, C=US</subjectDN> <validOn>2016-12-12T15:35:10-0500</validOn> </certificate> </certificates> chargebackData

The chargebackData data type describes the chargebackData property of the chargebackReport data type. The chargebackReport data type is used to generate chargeback reports.

Most of the properties in the chargebackData data type represent statistics that describe the usage of a given namespace or of all the namespaces owned by a given tenant. In a chargeback report, each set of these statistics applies to one namespace or tenant during a given reporting interval (for example, one hour or one day).

Chargeback statistics either reflect a point in time or are dynamic. Point-in-time statistics are measurements taken at the end of a reporting interval, such as the used storage capacity for a namespace at the end of an hour. Dynamic statistics are measurements, such as the number of reads or writes to a namespace, that are accumulated over time. HCP accumulates dynamic statistics on an hourly basis, starting at the beginning of each hour. So, for example, if the reporting interval is an hour, one statistic might represent the number of successful writes to a namespace that occurred between 11:00:00 and 11:59:59. If the reporting interval is a day, each reported dynamic statistic is the sum of the hourly values for the day, where the day starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:59:59. Properties

The table below describes the properties included in the chargebackData data type. When the output format for a chargebackReport resource is CSV, the properties included in the chargebackData data type are ordered. This table lists the properties in the order in which they appear in a CSV response body. Property name
