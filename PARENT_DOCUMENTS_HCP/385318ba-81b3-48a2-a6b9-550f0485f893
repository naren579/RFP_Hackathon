replication Links

Specifies the replication links included in the erasure coding topology.

This property is required on a PUT request. It is not valid on a POST request.

The properties returned for each replication link in response to a GET request for an erasure coding topology depend on whether the request includes the verbose=true query parameter. restorePeriod

Integer

Specifies the restore period for the erasure coding topology as a number of days. Valid values are integers in the range zero through 180. The default is zero

This property is optional on a PUT request.

state

String

This property is not valid on a PUT or POST request.

Specifies the state of the erasure coding topology. Possible values are: ACTIVE

The topology is currently being used to erasure-code newly ingested objects that are subject to erasure coding.

RETIRED

The topology is retired.

RETIRING

The topology is in the process of retiring.

tenants

List

Lists the tenants included in the erasure coding topology.

This property is not valid on a PUT or POST request.

In XML, the element that identifies each tenant is name. In JSON, the name in the name/value pair that lists the tenants is name. type

String

Specifies the type of the underlying replication topology. Valid values for an erasure coding topology with four, five, or six systems are:

This property is required on a PUT request. It is not valid on a POST request.

FULLY_CONNECTED

The erasure coding topology is based on a fully connected active/active replication topology. RING

The erasure coding topology is based on an active/active replication ring topology.

For an erasure coding topology with three systems, the value of this property must be FULLY_CONNECTED.

These values are not case-sensitive. Example

Here's an XML example of the ecTopology data type; the properties shown are those that are returned in response to a verbose GET request:

<ecTopology> <description>Erasure coding topology for the US, Europe, Canada, and Africa-North divisions.</description> <erasureCodedObjects>3289</erasureCodedObjects> <erasureCodingDelay>10</erasureCodingDelay> <fullCopy>false</fullCopy>
