                       <b>Title:</b> You can create and searches that are more complex by using Boolean operations in the search criteria. To specify these operations, you use the plus and minus signs: any all
A plus sign (+) prefixed to a search term means returned objects must contain that term.
A minus sign (-) prefixed to a search term means returned objects cannot contain that term.
You can use plus signs and minus signs on multiple terms, with or without wildcards, and in any order. When used with a quoted term, the symbol comes before the opening
quotation mark.
Boolean criteria in any searches
The table below describes how Boolean criteria work in searches. any<br>
