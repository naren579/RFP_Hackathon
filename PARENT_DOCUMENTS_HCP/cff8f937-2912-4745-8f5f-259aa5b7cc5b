Content Platform System Management Help

These considerations apply to modifying HCP tenants: You can enable AD authentication for a tenant only while HCP can communicate with AD. When you rename a tenant for which AD authentication is enabled, AD authentication is automatically disabled for that tenant. After the operation is complete, you need to manually reenable AD authentication for the tenant. You cannot rename a tenant while the only account with the security role defined for the tenant is a group account. You cannot rename a tenant while the CIFS or NFS protocol is enabled for any namespaces owned by that tenant. When you select a different management network for an HCP tenant while any given user is logged in to the Tenant Management Console for that tenant, HCP denies any subsequent requests made within the same Console session. To continue using the Console, you must start a new session so that the client can use the new management network to access the Console for the tenant. When you select a different data access network for an HCP tenant, HCP denies any client requests for access to namespaces owned by that tenant that arrive over the previously selected network. When a tenant is replicated from one system to a second system, if the management or data access network selected for the tenant on the first system does not exist on the second system, the applicable field in the tenant Settings panel on the second system shows the network name enclosed in angle brackets (for example, <ten1_data>). This network is not included in the dropdown list for the field, so if you select a different network in that field, you cannot then select the undefined network.

You can change the service plan thatâ€™s assigned to a specific tenant by modifying the tenant to select the new service plan or by modifying the new service plan to assign it to the tenant. You can also modify a service plan to assign it to multiple tenants at the same time.

To modify the configuration settings for an individual tenant, including selecting a new service plan for that tenant, follow the procedure outlined below. Modifying tenant properties

If all of these are true, a confirming message appears: You changed the name of the tenant. The tenant supports AD authentication.

HCP cannot communicate with AD. In response to the confirming message, click Update Settings.

Tenant-level CORS rules configuration

You can configure CORS rules at the tenant level to serve as the default configuration for all namespaces owned by a tenant. This practice is useful in deployments where a large number of namespaces support the same CORS configuration.
