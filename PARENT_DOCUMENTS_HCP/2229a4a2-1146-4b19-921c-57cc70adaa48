All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date

Specifies the date and time at which the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. For the valid values for this header, see the description of the Date header above. Optional headers

x-hcp-pretty-print

Optionally, requests that the XML response body be formatted for readability. Valid values are:

true

Format the XML response body for readability.

false

Do not apply any special formatting to the XML response body.

The default is false. The values true and false are not case sensitive. Response headers

Content-Type

Specifies the Internet media type of the response body. For a request to list the contents of a bucket, the value of this header is always application/xml;charset=UTF-8.

Date

The date and time when HCP responded to the request, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The date and time are returned in this format: DDD dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss GMT

For example:

Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:27:05 GMT

Transfer-Encoding

Indicates that HCP could not determine the size of the response body before formulating the response. For a request to list the buckets you own, the value of this header is always chunked.

Response body

HCP returns the list of buckets you own in an XML response body, in this format:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <ListAllMyBucketsResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/"> <Owner> <ID>bucket-owner-user-id</ID> <DisplayName>bucket-owner-username</DisplayName> </Owner> <Buckets> Format for a bucket: <Bucket> <Name>bucket-name</Name> <CreationDate>bucket-creation-date-and-time</CreationDate> </Bucket> . . . </Buckets> </ListAllMyBucketsResult> Bucket

Child of the ListAllMyBucketsResult element and container for the Name and CreationDate elements. The response body contains one Bucket element for each bucket you own.

CreationDate

Child of the Bucket element. The CreationDate element specifies the date and time when the applicable bucket was created, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The date and time are expressed in this format: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ

For example:

2020-02-18T19:46:03.856Z
