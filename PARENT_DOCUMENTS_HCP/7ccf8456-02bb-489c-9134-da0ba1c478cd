Query parameter for forcing the deletion of an erasure coding topology

You can delete an erasure coding topology only while either of these is true:

At least one system in the topology is available, the total number of erasure-coded objects and erasure-coded parts of multipart objects on each available system is zero, and the state of the topology is retired. These are the normal conditions for deleting a topology. No more than one system in the topology is unavailable, the total number of erasure-coded objects and erasure-coded parts of multipart objects on each available system is zero, and the state of the topology is retiring. To delete the topology under these conditions, you need to include the force=true query parameter on the DELETE request. Important: Deleting an erasure coding topology under these conditions may result in inaccessible data in namespaces on the unavailable system, even if those namespaces are configured to be compliant. You should delete the topology only if that system is no longer needed. If the system is still needed, wait to delete the topology until the topology has finished retiring on all systems.

Here's a sample DELETE request that deletes the erasure coding topology named ex-corp-3 while the topology meets the second set of conditions listed above: curl -k -X DELETE -H "Authorization: HCP bGdyZWVu:35dc4c4aa08fe0deab7e292e00eb8e97" "https://admin.hcp-us.example.com:9090/mapi/services/erasureCoding/ ecTopologies/ex-corp-3?force=true"
