Different tenants can have user accounts with the\nsame username.\nYou can reuse usernames that are not currently in use.\nSo, for example, if you delete the account for a user and\nthen create a new account for that user, you can give the\nuser the same username as before.\nTip: Consider using email addresses as user names. This\nenables users to more easily remember their HCP\nusernames. It also gives you easy access to email\naddresses should you need to contact any users.</td>
