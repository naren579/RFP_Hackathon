Retrieving an object or multiple versions of an object

You use the HTTP GET method to retrieve an object, a version of an object, or a range of versions of an object from a namespace. When retrieving an single object or version, you can request all the object data or part of the data. When retrieving multiple versions of an object, you can only request all the object data.

You can use a GET request to retrieve all the object data of a single object or version and an annotation together. You cannot retrieve part of the object data together with an

annotation in a single request. You can also use a GET request to retrieve the timestamp range of an object, which you can use to find a version of that object.

Using GET with a symbolic link returns the current version of the object that is the target of the link. Note: Attempts to retrieve the current version of a deleted object result in an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error code. However, if versioning is enabled, you can retrieve the version you

deleted by specifying its version ID.

Access permission

To retrieve an object or version, you need read permission.

Request header GET /rest/directory/file?version=@version&deleted=true HTTP/1.1

The GET request to retrieve an object has these elements:

If you are accessing the namespace as an authenticated user, an Authorization header The URL of the object or symbolic link

Parameter

Required

Description

These rules apply to the version query parameter:

If you omit the parameter, HCP checks the

existence of the current version of an object. If you specify a valid range, HCP returns the requested amount of data with a status code of 200.

deleted

No

By default, the GET request to retrieve object versions

does not include delete records. To retrieve a listing that includes delete records, specify this URL query

parameter:

deleted=true

You can also specify deleted=false, which results in the default behavior. forceEtag

No

To force HCP to generate an ETag for an object that does not yet have one, specify a forceEtag URL query parameter with a value of true.

nowait

No

HCP may detect that a GET request will take a significant amount of time to return an object. You can choose to

have the request fail in this situation instead of waiting for

HCP to return the object.
