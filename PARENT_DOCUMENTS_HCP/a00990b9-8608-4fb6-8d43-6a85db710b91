Query parameters for Replication service actions

To shut down all replication links in which the HCP system participates, you use this query parameter: shutDownAllLinks=reason

reason is a text string that specifies the reason why you’re shutting down all links. This string can be up to 1,024 characters long and can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, including white space. The string you specify must be percent encoded.

To reestablish all replication links in which the HCP system participates after they have been shut down, you use this query parameter: reestablishAllLinks

You use the shutDownAllLinks and reestablishAllLinks query parameters with a POST request against the replication resource. You cannot include a request body with this request.

Here’s a sample POST request that shuts down all replication links:

curl -k -iX POST -H "Authorization: HCP YWxscm9sZXM=:04EC9F614D89FF5C7126D32ACB448382" "https://admin.hcp-ma.example.com:9090/mapi/services/replication ?shutDownAllLinks=More%20bandwidth%20for%20app%20XYZ" retentionClass
