<failoverSettings> <remote> <autoFailover>true</autoFailover> <autoFailoverMinutes>120</autoFailoverMinutes> <autoCompleteRecovery>false</autoCompleteRecovery> <autoCompleteRecoveryMinutes>60</autoCompleteRecoveryMinutes> </remote> </failoverSettings>

Specifies whether the group account has the allow namespace management property. Valid values are:

This property is not valid on a PUT request. It is valid on a POST request only if the user making the request has the administrator role. true

The group account has the allow namespace property.

false

The group account does not have the allow namespace management property.

On a PUT request, the default is true if the roles property includes ADMINISTRATOR in the same request; otherwise, the default is false.

On a POST request, adding ADMINISTRATOR to the roles for the group account automatically enables the allow namespace management property for the account.

Users in groups with the allow namespace management property can use the HCP management and S3 compatible APIs to:

Either this property or the groupname property is required on a PUT request. If you include both properties in the request body, they must identify the same AD group.

This property is not valid on a POST request. It is returned only by a verbose GET request and only when the user making the request has the security role. groupname

Specifies the name of the HCP group account. For a PUT request, valid values are the names of AD groups defined in the AD forest supported by HCP, in either of these formats:

Either this property or the externalGroupID property is required on a PUT request. If you include both properties in the request body, they must identify the same AD group.
