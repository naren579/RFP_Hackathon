Required headers

The next list describes the headers you can use in a request to retrieve an object. Authorization

Specifies user credentials or requests anonymous access.

Date

Specifies the date and time when the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. The date and time must always be specified using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To specify the date and time, use this format: DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

In this format:

DDD

The three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Mon).

dd

The two-digit day of the month.

MMM

The three-letter abbreviation for the month, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Feb). yyyy

The four-digit year.

HH

The hour on a 24-hour clock.

mm

The number of minutes.

ss

The number of seconds.

For example:

Thu, 23 Mar 2017 14:27:05 +0000

All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date

Specifies the date and time at which the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. For the valid values for this header, see the description of the Date header above. Optional request headers

If-Match

Specifies one or more values for comparison with the ETag of the specified object or object version. If the ETag matches one of the specified values, HCP continues processing the request. If the ETag does not match any of the specified values, HCP returns a 412 (Precondition Failed) status code. To specify the values for this header, use this format: "value"[, "value"]...

In this format, each value can be any string of one or more characters and must be enclosed in double quotation marks ("). Alternatively, you can specify a single asterisk (*) as the value for the If-Match header. All ETags match an asterisk in an If-Match header.

If-Modified-Since

Specifies a date and time, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), for comparison with the date and time the specified object or object version was last modified. If the modification date and time is later than the specified date and time, HCP continues processing the request. If the modification date and time is equal to or earlier than the specified date and time, HCP returns a 304 (Not Modified) status code. To specify the date and time for this header, use one of these formats: DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

For example: Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:27:05 +0000

DDDD, dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

For example: Tuesday, 07-Feb-17 14:27:05 +0000

DDD MMM d HH:mm:ss yyyy

For example: Tue Feb 7 14:27:05 2017

If the value specified by the If-Modified-Since header doesnâ€™t conform to one of the formats shown above, the header is ignored. If-None-Match
