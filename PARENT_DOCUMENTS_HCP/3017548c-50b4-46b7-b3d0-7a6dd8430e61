A tenant can have at most 100 group accounts. Administrative roles and permissions

A role is a named collection of permissions that can be granted to a user either through an HCP user account or through one or more HCP group accounts. Each permission in a role lets the user perform some specific interaction or set of interactions with the HCP system. Roles generally correspond to job functions.

You can associate any number of roles with a user or group account. The account user then has all the permissions granted by each of those roles. Tip: Before associating roles with a user or group account, make sure the permissions granted by those roles are consistent with job functions of the user or group for which you’re creating the account. Note: An AD user can be added to an AD group while that user is using the Tenant Management Console. If the AD group corresponds to an existing HCP group account, the user may not automatically get the roles associated with that group account for up to eight hours. To get the roles immediately, the user needs to log out of the Tenant Management

Console and then log back in. If the user is also currently using the HCP System Management Console or the Namespace Browser, logging out of either of those interfaces has the same effect. Available roles

The roles you can associate with a user or group account are:

Monitor

Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant and its namespaces and most aspects of the tenant and namespace configurations. The monitor role does not grant permission to view user or group accounts. Administrator

Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant and its namespaces and perform most tenant and namespace configuration activities. The administrator role also grants permission to associate data access permissions with user and group accounts but not to view or manage any other aspects of user and group accounts. Security

Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant, configure Console and HCP management API security, and view security events

in the tenant log. The security role also grants permission to create and manage user and group accounts, including associating roles with them but not viewing or managing their data access permissions. Compliance

Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to work with retention classes and retention-related settings and perform privileged deletes, as well as to view tenant status, namespace status, and compliance events in the tenant log.
