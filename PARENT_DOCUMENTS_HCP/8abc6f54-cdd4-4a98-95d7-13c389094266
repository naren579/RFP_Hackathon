X-HCP-ContentLength

The size of the annotation, in bytes. This header is returned only if the request specifies a compressed response. X-HCP-Hash

The cryptographic hash algorithm HCP uses, along with the cryptographic hash value stored for the object, in this format:

X-HCP-Hash: hash-algorithmhash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored data is the same as the data you sent. To perform the verification, compare this value with a hash value that you generate from the original data. The

X-HCP-Hash

header is not returned for multipart objects.

X-HCP-Size

The size of the object data, in bytes.

X-HCP-SymlinkTarget

The path to the target object as specified when the symbolic link was created.

This header is returned only if the URL specifies a symbolic link to an object. If this header is returned, the X-HCP-ACL value is always false. X-HCP-Type
