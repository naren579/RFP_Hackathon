The list below describes the headers returned in response to a successful request to upload a part of a multipart upload.

Content-length

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the response body. In response to a successful request to upload a part of a multipart upload, the value of this header is always 0 (zero). Date

The date and time when HCP responded to the request, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The date and time are returned in this format:

DDD dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss GMT

For example:

Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:27:05 GMT

ETag

Specifies the ETag for the object. ETags are useful for making object-level operations conditional based on the object content. Operations that can be made conditional are checking the existence of an object, copying an object, and retrieving an object. x-amz-server-side-encryption

Specifies whether objects stored in HCP are encrypted. Possible values are:

If objects are encrypted, AES256 If objects are not encrypted, None

This header is returned only if the request headers include x-amz-server-side-encryption.

x-amz-version-id

Specifies the version ID of the object. This header is returned only while versioning is enabled for the bucket. Status codes

The specified multipart upload does not exist. Either the upload ID is invalid, or the multipart upload was aborted or completed.

In the case of completion, if the part being uploaded is a replacement for an existing part, the existing part is used for completing the multipart upload.

The specified bucket does not exist.

411 Length Required

Either the request does not include a Content-Length header, or the request includes a Content-Length header with no value.

Example: Uploading a part

Hereâ€™s a sample PUT request that uploads a part of the multipart upload for an object named acctg/RulesAndRegulations.pdf in the finance bucket. The data for the part is in a file named /file-parts-temp/RulesAndRegs-Acctg-1.

The example shows the response headers HCP returns while versioning is enabled for the bucket and while versioning is disabled for the bucket. Request with s3curl command line
