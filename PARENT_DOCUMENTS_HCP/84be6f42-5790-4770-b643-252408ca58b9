With the x-amz-meta- header, you specify custom metadata as property/value pairs. You append the property name to the header and specify the value of the property as the value of the header. For example, to give an object a department property with a value of Sales&Mktg and a year property with a value of 2020, you would specify these headers: x-amz-meta-department: Sales&Mktg x-amz-meta-year: 2020

HCP stores the custom metadata you specify with the S3 compatible API as an annotation named .metapairs. In this annotation, the property/value pairs are stored as well-formed XML in which each property is represented by an element. For example, the XML stored for the headers shown above is:

<metapairs version="600"> <meta-department><![CDATA[Sales&Mktg]]></meta-department>

The root element in the .metapairs annotation is metapairs. For each property/value pair, the name of the corresponding element is the concatenation of meta- and the property name, modified if necessary to be a valid XML element name. Valid XML element names can contain alphanumeric characters, periods (.), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and colons (:). When creating element names from property names, HCP changes any other character to an underscore. For example, the property name city/town becomes the element name city_town.

For each property/value pair, the property value becomes the value of the corresponding element. This value is enclosed in a CDATA section.

If you specify an x-amz-meta- header with no value, HCP doesn’t store an element for the property named in the header. If all the x-amz-meta- headers you specify have no value, HCP doesn’t create a .metapairs annotation for the object. In a request to store or copy an object, you can specify the same x-amz-meta- property multiple times with different values. In the .metapairs annotation XML, these values are stored as comma-separated values for a single element.

Here’s an example that shows three occurrences of the same property along with the resulting XML: x-amz-meta-author: P.D. Grey

x-amz-meta-author: Morgan White x-amz-meta-author: Paris Black

<metapairs> <meta-author> <![CDATA[P.D. Grey,Morgan White,Paris Black]]> </meta-author> </metapairs>

Property names are case sensitive, so names that differ only in case correspond to separate XML elements. For example, these x-amz-meta- headers result in three separate XML elements: x-amz-meta-date_written, x-amz-meta-Date_Written, and x-amz-meta-DATE_WRITTEN.

Retrieving custom metadata with the S3 compatible API

When you check the existence of or retrieve an object that has a .metapairs annotation containing well-formed XML, the response headers include x-amz-meta- headers with property/value pairs that correspond to the XML elements in the annotation. The property names in these headers are the element names with the initial meta- removed. An element with comma-separated values is returned as a single x-amz-meta- header with comma-separated values. Here’s an example that shows an XML element with comma- separated values and the x-amz-meta- header that results from that element:

<meta-author> <![CDATA[P.D. Grey,Morgan White,Paris Black]]> </meta-author>

x-amz-meta-author:P.D. Grey,Morgan White,Paris Black

Custom metadata usage considerations

The following considerations apply to using custom metadata with the S3 compatible API.

Custom metadata and object versions

Custom metadata is specific to the object version for which it's stored:
