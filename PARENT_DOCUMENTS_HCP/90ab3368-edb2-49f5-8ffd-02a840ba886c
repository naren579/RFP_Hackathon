Adding access points to an extended storage component

To view the Storage page, you need the monitor or administrator role. To create, modify, or delete extended storage components and extended storage pools, you need the administrator role. 1. On the left side of the Storage page, click the Components tab. 2. On the Components panel, click the table row that contains the name of the component for which you want to configure one or more new access points.

3. At the top of the panel that opens, click the tab that corresponds to the type of access point that’s used for the component (Mount Points, Buckets, or Containers). 4. At the bottom of the panel that opens, click Add AccessPointType.

5. For every type of extended storage except NFS, in the window that opens, use the dropdown list to select the account label that’s associated with the user account that’s

used to access the bucket or container you want to add, and click Go. The window does not appear if you’re adding a mount point to an NFS storage component.

The Add AccessPointType wizard opens, displaying a table that contains a list of existing access points (mount points, buckets, or containers) that are available for use, along with a check box that corresponds to each access point in the list.

6. Click AccessPointType Actions.

7. Take either or both of these actions:

To add existing access points to the storage component:

a. In the AccessPointType Actions section, in the Action field, select Add existing.

When you first expand the AccessPointType Actions section, Add existing is selected by default.

b. Use the check boxes in the left column in the table to select each existing access point that you want to add to the storage component configuration. c. Click Go.

To create one or more new buckets or containers for use by the specified user account or to create one or more mount points:

a. In the AccessPointType Actions section, in the Action field, select Create new.

b. In the AccessPointTypeName field, for each new access point you want to create, type a name for the new access point, and click Go.

Each new access point you create is added to the list of existing access points, and its checkbox is automatically selected.

Note: You can delete any new access point from the list before you actually create the new access point on the extended storage device. To do this, click the delete control (

) in the row that corresponds to the access point name.

c. When you’re finished creating new access points, in the Action field, select Add existing, and then click Go.

8. When you’re finished adding both new and existing access points to the extended storage components, click Finish at the bottom of the panel.

When you click Finish, the Add AccessPointType wizard exits, and the AccessPointType panel (Mount Points, Buckets, or Containers) for the storage component you’ve modified appears, showing the list of access points that are currently configured for the component and the current status of each access point. All of the new and existing

access points you’ve just added are included in the list.
