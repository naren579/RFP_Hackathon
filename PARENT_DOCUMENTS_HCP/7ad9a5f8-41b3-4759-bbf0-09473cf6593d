These considerations apply to symbolic links:

If you use CIFS to create a symbolic link, you can read through the link only with CIFS. You cannot use CIFS to read through a symbolic link created with NFS. REST API and WebDAV support for reading through symbolic links is limited to retrieving object data. Other REST API and WebDAV operations on symbolic links may produce unexpected results.

Tip: You can use the HCP Search Console to delete, purge, hold, release, change ownership, or modify ACLs on multiple objects with a single operation.
