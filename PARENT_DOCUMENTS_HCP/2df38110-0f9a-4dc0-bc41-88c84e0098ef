What an individual user can do in a namespace is also limited by the permissions the user has from the applicable user or group accounts and, for HCP namespaces, the minimum data access permissions for the namespace.

The Permissions page in the HCP System Management Console lets you set the systemwide permission mask. You can change this mask at any time.

Tip: Before changing the systemwide permission mask, you should notify your tenant contacts.

To display the Permissions page, in the top-level menu of the System Management Console, select Security > Permissions.

To view the Permissions page, you need the monitor or administrator role. To set the systemwide permission mask, you need the administrator role.

2. Click Update Settings. System monitoring

HCP maintains a system log in which it records messages about events that happen within the system. You can view this log in the HCP System Management Console. You also have the option of sending system log messages to syslog servers, SNMP managers, and/or email addresses. Additionally, you can use SNMP to view and, when allowed, change HCP system settings.

The System Management Console lets you monitor CPU, memory, logical-volume, and network usage. You can use the information presented to analyze trends in the use of these resources and to decide when you need to take action to ensure that HCP uses its resources effectively.

To track system capacity and bandwidth usage at the tenant and namespace levels, you can generate chargeback reports. These reports can be used as input to billing applications. You can configure HCP to push information to Hitachi Device Manager (HDvM) so you can monitor and manage HCP along with your other Hitachi storage systems from a single console.
