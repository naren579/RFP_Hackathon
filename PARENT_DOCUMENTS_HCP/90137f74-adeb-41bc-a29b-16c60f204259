Creating a folder

You use the HTTP PUT method to create a folder in a bucket. To create a folder, you need write permission for the bucket.

To tell HCP to create a folder instead of an object in response to a PUT request, you can do either these:

Include a forward slash (/) or the percent-encoded equivalent (%2F) after the folder name in the request. Include the Content-Type header in the request with a value of x-directory.

In either case, you also need to include the Content-Length header in the request. However, HCP ignores any request body.

When you create a folder, you specify a name for it. The rules for folder names are the same as the rules for object names. Request line

Depending on whether the bucket name is included in the hostname in the S3 compatible request, a request to create a folder has either of these formats:

With the bucket name included in the hostname:

PUT /folder-name[(/|%2F)] HTTP/1.1

With the bucket name following the hostname:

PUT /bucket-name/folder-name[(/|%2F)] HTTP/1.1

Required headers

The list below describes the headers you can use in a request to create a folder. Authorization

Specifies user credentials or requests anonymous access.

Content-Length

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the data being stored. In a request to create a folder, the value of this header should be 0 (zero). Even if you specify a value greater than zero for this header, no request body is sent to HCP. Date

Specifies the date and time when the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. The date and time must always be specified using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). To specify the date and time, use this format:

DDD, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss (+0000|GMT)

In this format: DDD

The three-letter abbreviation for the day of the week, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Mon).

dd

The two-digit day of the month.

MMM

The three-letter abbreviation for the month, with an uppercase first letter (for example, Feb).

For example:

All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date
