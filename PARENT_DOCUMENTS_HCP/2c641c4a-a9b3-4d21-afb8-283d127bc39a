Child of the ListVersionsResult element. The NextVersionIdMarker element specifies the version ID of the last item included in the returned bucket listing. This element is included in the response body only when the value of the IsTruncated element is true. If the returned listing is truncated, you can use the value of the NextVersionIdMarker element as the value of the version-id-marker query parameter in a new request to retrieve the next set of items that satisfy the request criteria. Owner

Child of the Contents, Version, or DeleteMarker element and container for the DisplayName and ID elements. The Owner element identifies the owner of the applicable item.

Prefix

Child of the ListBucketResult or ListVersionsResult element.

In this case, the Prefix element specifies the value of the prefix query parameter included in the request. If the request did not include the prefix query parameter, the response body includes Prefix as an empty element. Child of the CommonPrefixes element.

In this case, the Prefix element specifies a common prefix.

Size

Child of the Contents or Version element. The Size element specifies the size, in bytes, of the content of the item or item version. The response body includes Size elements for the listed folders. However, because folders have no content, the value of this element for a folder is always 0 (zero). StorageClass

Child of the Contents or Version element. The value of the StorageClass element is always STANDARD.

Version

Child of the ListVersionsResult element and container for the elements that describe a version of an item in the bucket. The response body contains one Version element for each item version that satisfies the request criteria. VersionId

Child of the Version or DeleteMarker element. The VersionId element specifies the version ID of an item version.

VersionIdMarker

Child of the ListVersionsResult element. The VersionIdMarker element specifies the value of the version-id-marker query parameter included in the request. If the request did not include the version-id-marker query parameter, the response body includes VersionIdMarker as an empty element.

Example: Listing the items in a folder

Hereâ€™s a sample GET request for a bucket listing that lists the objects that are in the mktg folder and, separately, the subfolders that are in the mktg folder. The request uses these query parameters: prefix=mktg/

Lists only items that start with mktg/

marker=mktg/

Starts the listing with the item that follows mktg/ by itself

delimiter=/

Treats items that have a forward slash (/) after mktg/ as having a common prefix

Request with s3curl command line

./s3curl.pl --id=lgreen -- -k "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com?prefix=mktg/ &marker=mktg/&delimiter=/" -H "x-hcp-pretty-print: true" Request headers
