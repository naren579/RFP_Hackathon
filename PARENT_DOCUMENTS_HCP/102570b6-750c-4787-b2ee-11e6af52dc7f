Listing namespace statistics

You use the HTTP GET method to list statistics for a namespace. The values returned include information such as the total and used capacity of the namespace and the number of

objects with annotations. Request header

GET /proc/statistics HTTP/1.1

Response headers

This operation does not return any request-specific response headers.

Response body

namespaceName

The namespace name.

totalCapacityBytes

The number of bytes of storage allocated to the namespace. This is the total space available for all data stored in the namespace, including object data, metadata, and the

redundant data required to satisfy the namespace DPL. usedCapacityBytes

The number of bytes currently occupied by all data stored in the namespace, including object data, metadata, and any redundant data required to satisfy the namespace DPL.

softQuotaPercent

The percent of the totalCapacityBytes value at which HCP notifies the tenant that free storage space for the namespace is running low.

Content Platform System Management Help

The number of objects, including old versions of objects, stored in the namespace.

The object count includes versions of objects that were deleted, but not delete markers or delete records. For example, if you create an object, add a version, delete the

object while versioning is enabled but without specifying a version ID, and then add a new version of the object, the object count increases by three. shredObjectCount

The number of objects and versions that have been deleted and are waiting to be shredded.

shredObjectBytes

The number of bytes occupied by the objects and versions that are waiting to be shredded.

customMetadataObjectCount

The number of objects and versions that have one or more annotations. customMetadataObjectBytes

The number of bytes occupied by custom metadata in all annotations for all objects.

Status codes

If you request information about a namespace to which you do not have access, HCP returns an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) error code.

Example: Listing statistics for a namespace

Hereâ€™s a sample HTTP GET request that retrieves statistics for the finance namespace owned by the europe tenant in the hcp.example.com system. Request with curl command line

curl -k -H "Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d" "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/proc/statistics"

Request in Python using PycURL

import pycurl curl = pycurl.Curl()

curl.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d"])

curl.setopt(pycurl.URL, "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com \ /proc/statistics") curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0)

curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0) curl.perform()
