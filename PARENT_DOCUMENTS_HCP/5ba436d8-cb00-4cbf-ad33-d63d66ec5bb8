ADMINISTRATOR COMPLIANCE MONITOR SECURITY

The default is no roles.

In XML, the element that identifies each role is role. In JSON, the name in the name/value pair that lists the roles is role. userGUID

String

Specifies the system-supplied globally unique user ID for the user account. HCP generates this ID automatically when you create an account.

This property is not valid on a PUT or POST request. It is returned only by a verbose GET request and only when the user making the request has the security role. userID

Integer

Specifies the system-supplied local user ID for the user account. HCP generates this ID automatically when you create an account.

This property is not valid on a PUT or POST request. It is returned only by a verbose GET request and only when the user making the request has the security role.

Local user IDs are unique within an HCP system. These IDs are maintained for backward compatibility but are no longer used for user identification. username

String

Specifies the username for the user account. Usernames must be from one through 64 characters long and can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, including white space, but cannot start with an opening square bracket ([).

This property is required on a PUT request. It is valid on a POST request only when the user making the request has the security role.

Usernames are not case sensitive.

The username for a user account must be unique for the tenant. Different tenants can have user accounts with the same username.

You can reuse usernames that are not currently in use. So, for example, if you delete the account for a user and then create a new account for that user, you can give the user the same username as before.

Tip: Consider using email addresses as user names. This

enables users to more easily remember their HCP usernames. It also gives you easy access to email addresses should you need to contact any users.

Query parameter for setting user account passwords You use the password query parameter to specify the password for a new user account and to change the password for an existing user account. The value of this parameter is the password you want.
