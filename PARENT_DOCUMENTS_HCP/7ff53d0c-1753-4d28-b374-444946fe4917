Here’s an XML example of the licenses data type:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?> <licenses> <license> <localCapacity>10000000000000</activeCapacity> <expirationDate>Jan 1, 2021</expirationDate> <extendedCapacity>0</extendedCapacity> <feature>Premium</feature> <serialNumber>12345</serialNumber> <uploadDate>Aug 14, 2016</uploadDate> </license> </licenses>

Query parameter for retrieving a list of licenses

To retrieve a list of all the storage licenses that have ever been uploaded to the HCP system, you use this query parameter: verbose=true

Here’s a sample GET request that retrieves both the current and past storage licenses for an HCP system:

curl -k -b -H “Accept:application/xml -H "Authorization: HCP YWxscm9sZXM=:04EC9F614D89FF5C7126D32ACB448382" https://admin.hcp.example.com:9090/mapi/storage/licenses?verbose=true
