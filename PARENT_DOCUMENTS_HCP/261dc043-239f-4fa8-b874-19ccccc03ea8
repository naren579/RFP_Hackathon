                       <b>Title:</b> This topic contains a quick reference to the S3 compatible API methods. For each method, the topic shows:
The query parameters you can use in requests that use the method. Required parameters are listed first followed by optional parameters enclosed in square brackets ([]).
The request headers for requests that use the method. Required headers are listed first followed by optional headers enclosed in square brackets.
The methods are grouped by the level of access (service (that is, tenant), bucket, or object, with methods for multipart uploads in a separate group at the end). Within each group,
the methods are presented in alphabetical order.
For general information on S3 compatible API requests, see Request line.
