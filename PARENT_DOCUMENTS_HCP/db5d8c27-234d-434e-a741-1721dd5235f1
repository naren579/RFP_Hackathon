                       <b>Title:</b> The roles you can associate with a user or group account are:
Monitor
Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant and its namespaces and most aspects of the tenant and namespace
configurations. The monitor role does not grant permission to view user or group accounts.
Administrator
Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant and its namespaces and perform most tenant and namespace configuration
activities. The administrator role also grants permission to associate data access permissions with user and group accounts but not to view or manage any other aspects of
user and group accounts.
Security
Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to view the status of the tenant, configure Console and HCP management API security, and view security events
in the tenant log. The security role also grants permission to create and manage user and group accounts, including associating roles with them but not viewing or managing
their data access permissions.
Compliance
Grants permission to use the Tenant Management Console to work with retention classes and retention-related settings and perform privileged deletes, as well as to view
tenant status, namespace status, and compliance events in the tenant log.
