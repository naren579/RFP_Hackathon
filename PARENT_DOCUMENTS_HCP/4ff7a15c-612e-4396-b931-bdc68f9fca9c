Specifying retention values

These properties require you to specify a retention value:

The retentionDefault property of the complianceSettings data type. The value of this property can be a special value, offset, retention class, or fixed date. The minimumRetentionAfterInitialUnspecified property of the complianceSettings data type. The value of this property can be an offset. The value property of the retentionClass data type. The value of this property can be a special value or an offset.

Specifying a special value

To specify a special value as a retention value, use one of these: 0 Deletion Allowed

Allows the object to be deleted at any time.

1 Deletion Prohibited

Prevents the object from ever being deleted by means of a normal delete operation. If the namespace is in enterprise mode, however, the object can be deleted by means of a privileged delete operation.

2 Initial Unspecified

Prevents the object from being deleted but allows its retention setting to be changed.

These values are not case sensitive.

Specifying an offset

To specify an offset as a retention value, use a standard expression that conforms to this syntax:

^A([+-]\d+y)?([+-]\d+M)?([+-]\d+w)?([+-]\d+d)?([+-]\d+h)?([+-]\d+m)?([+-]\d+s)?$

The list below explains this syntax.
