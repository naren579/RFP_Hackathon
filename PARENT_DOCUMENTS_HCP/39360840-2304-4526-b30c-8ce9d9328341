✓ Troubleshooting

From the system console for any HCP node, you can run selected diagnostics that can help with analyzing and resolving issues with interactions between the node and other components in the HCP environment.

Additionally, HCP maintains internal logs that can help support personnel resolve problems. Using the System Management Console, you can insert messages into these internal logs. For example, you can insert messages that describe conditions that could indicate a problem with the HCP system. If problems occur with the HCP system, you can download the internal logs into a single file, which you can then send to your HCP support center. This chapter:

Describes the available diagnostics and explains how to run them

Contains instructions for marking and downloading the HCP internal logs

Running diagnostics

You can run selected diagnostics on the nodes in an HCP system to help analyze and resolve issues related to interactions between the nodes and other components in the HCP environment. The available diagnostics let you:

Ping a specified device (ping) Display the network path being used for communications between the node and a specified device (traceroute) Query the DNS for the records that match a specified IP address or domain name (dig) Display the routing table for the node (route)

Display the NFS exports table for a specified device (showmount) On HCP with SAN-attached storage systems, display information about the logical volumes that are mapped to the node on the Fibre Channel SAN arrays (fchbainfo) Display the ethtool command output command for both front-end interfaces (ethtool) You run diagnostics from the system console for a node. To use the system console, you need a keyboard and monitor.

To run diagnostics, you use the Appliance Diagnostics menu. To display this menu in the system console, press Alt+F8.
