Variables

The values you specify for the body, from, and subject properties of the emailTemplate data type can include variables that correspond to the information available for each log message (for example, the severity of the event that triggered the message or the short description of the event). When sending email, HCP replaces the variables in the email message with the applicable information.

To include a variable in the email template, you specify the variable name preceded by the dollar sign ($). A dollar sign followed by anything other than a variable name is displayed as a dollar sign in the email HCP sends.

The list below lists the variables you can use in the email template. $action
