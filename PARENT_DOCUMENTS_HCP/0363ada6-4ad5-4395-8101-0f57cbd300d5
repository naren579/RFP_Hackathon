Replicating tenants and namespaces

Geographically distributed data protection

An individual Hitachi Content Platform (HCP) system maintains a repository of objects in one or more namespaces. To ensure data availability and protect against data corruption, namespaces can be configured (using service plans) to store multiple copies of each object. However, storing multiple copies of objects on only one system does not provide protection against the unavailability or loss of that system. You can create a configuration in which selected tenants and namespaces are maintained on two or more HCP systems and the objects in those namespaces are managed across those systems. This cross-system management helps ensure that data is well-protected against the unavailability or catastrophic failure of a system. Depending on the number of systems and how you configure the relationships between them, data could even be protected against the concurrent unavailability or loss of more than one system.

Typically, the systems involved in cross-system data management are in separate geographic locations and are connected by a high-speed wide area network. This arrangement provides geographically distributed data protection (called geo-protection). You have multiple options for implementing geo-protection, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.

This section of the Help provides an overview of how geo-protection works and how it supports business continuity and disaster recovery. About geo-protection

Geo-protection is implemented by the HCP Replication service. The Replication service is responsible for keeping tenants and namespaces on two or more HCP systems in sync with each other. Replication entails sending information from the system where the service is running to one or more other systems. The information sent includes tenant and namespace configuration information, metadata and data for newly created objects, metadata changes for existing objects, and instructions to perform delete operations.
