Enabling the management API in the Consoles

1. Log into the System Management Console or Tenant Management Console using a user account with the security role. 2. In the top-level menu of either Console, select Security > MAPI. 3. In the Management API Setting section on the Management API page, select Enable the HCP management API.

4. Click Update Settings. Support for the Amazon S3 API

HCP is compatible with the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) REST API, which allows clients to store objects in namespaces. A namespace is a container for objects that has its own settings, such as ownership and lifecycle. Using HCP, users can perform common operations on objects and namespaces.

For information about using Amazon S3, see the Amazon S3 API documentation.

The following tables list the level of support for each of the HCP S3 API methods compared with the Amazon S3 API methods and describes any implementation differences in the S3 APIs. Amazon S3 API
