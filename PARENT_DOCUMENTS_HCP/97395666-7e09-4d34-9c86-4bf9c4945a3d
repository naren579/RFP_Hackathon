With the release of HCP 9.4, for example, one\nsuch tool was found to be the AWS Command Line\nInterface (AWS CLI). Similarly, HCP Anywhere 4.5.4\ndoes not yet support TLS 1.3. Therefore, setting HCP\nto TLS 1.3 minimum stops HCP-AW communications\nuntil HCP is changed back to use TLS 1.2 as\nmaximum TLS level. A future release of HCP\nAnywhere is expected to add support for TLS 1.3;\nplease refer to the appropriate release notes of HCP\nAnywhere for further information. Before turning on\nTLS 1.3 in HCP, make sure that the tools and SDKs\nused to connect to HCP through HTTPS connection\ndo support TLS v1.3.</td>
