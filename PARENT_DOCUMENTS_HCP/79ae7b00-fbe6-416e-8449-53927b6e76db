Content Platform System Management Help

You use the HTTP POST method to change the metadata for existing objects in a namespace. The request changes only the metadata that it explicitly specifies. All other metadata remains unchanged.

You can modify metadata only for the current version of an object. You cannot modify metadata for an old version.

If the request to change metadata specifies a symbolic link, HCP changes the metadata on the object that’s the target of the link. Access permission

To modify object metadata, you need write permission.

To specify a hold parameter, you also need privileged permission for the namespace.

To specify an owner parameter, you need change owner permission for the namespace.
