DisplayName

Child of the Initiator or Owner element. If the multipart upload initiator or object owner is identified by an HCP user account, the value of the DisplayName element is the user name for that account.

If the multipart upload initiator or object owner is identified by an AD user account, the value of the ID element is the SID for that account. Initiator

Child of the ListPartsResult element and container for the DisplayName and ID elements. The Initiator element identifies the user who initiated the multipart upload.
