If the directory that contains the object contained at some time a subdirectory with the same name as the object, the results of a version list request that includes delete records shows delete markers for both the object and the directory.

For example, assume you do the following:

1. Create a maintenance subdirectory of the departments directory. 2. Delete the maintenance directory.

3. Save a maintenance object in the departments directory.

In this case, a version listing for the maintenance entry that includes delete markers or delete records shows these items:

An entry, with a version ID, for the deleted maintenance directory Entries for all versions of the maintenance object, including any delete marker entries for the object

Version list entries for deleted directories look like this: <entry urlname="object-name" utf8Name="utf8-object-name"

type="directory"

state="deleted" version=version-id"

ingestTime="ingested-seconds-after-1/1/1970" ingestTimeString="ingested-datetime"

Example: Listing the versions of an object

Hereâ€™s a sample HTTP GET request that saves an XML listing of the versions of an object named Q1_2012.ppt located in the quarterly_rpts directory. The object has three versions:

the original version that was ingested, a delete marker, and a version that was ingested after the original version was deleted. The request asks for all versions, including delete records. Request with curl command line

curl -i -k -H "Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d" "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/rest/quarterly_rpts/

Q1_2012.ppt?version=list&deleted=true" > Q1_2012-versions.xml

Request in Python using PycURL
