Copying an object or version of an object
You use the HTTP PUT method to copy an object or existing version of an object from one location to another. The copy operation has these characteristics:
The source location can be any namespace, including the default namespace.
The target location must be an HCP namespace within the source tenant and can include the source namespace.
The name of the target object can differ from the name of the source object.
The copied object inherits all its system metadata from the target namespace default values and does not have any ACL values. However, you can specify whether custom
metadata is copied with the object data.
When versioning is enabled, the target object gets a new version ID that differs from the source object version ID.
You cannot store a new version of an object that is under retention or on hold in the target namespace.
Copying a large object can take some time. If a client times out because a copy operation is taking too long, HCP continues the operation in the background.
Because the connection to the client is broken, HCP cannot report the completion of the copy operation to the client. Until the operation is complete, HCP returns a 404 Not Found
status code in response to HEAD requests for the object being created by the copy operation.
After a copy operation finishes successfully, HCP returns information about the new object in response to HEAD requests for the object. If the operation does not succeed, HCP
continues to return a 404 Not Found status code in response to HEAD requests for the object.
If copy operations are causing a client to time out, consider increasing the client timeout interval.
Note: Depending on the replication configuration, copy operations may be slow, thereby increasing the likelihood of client timeouts.
Access permission
To copy an object or version, you need read permission for the source namespace and write permission for the target namespace.
Request header
PUT /rest/directory/file HTTP/1.1
The PUT request to copy an object or version of an object has these elements:
If youâ€™re accessing the target namespace as an authenticated user, an Authorization header
An header in this format: X-HCP-CopySource
X-HCP-CopySource: source-namespace-name.source-tenant-name/source-object-path
The value of the header must be URL-encoded. X-HCP-CopySource
A URL specifying the location in which to store the object
Note: If the header identifies a directory, HCP creates an empty directory with the path specified in the target URL, assuming the specified path does not already X-HCP-CopySource
exist.<br>
