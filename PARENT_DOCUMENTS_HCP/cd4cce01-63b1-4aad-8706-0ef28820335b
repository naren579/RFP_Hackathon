customMetadataContent:(+finance -foreign)

When you specify multiple values for a single property, you can combine values that are preceded by Boolean operators with values that do not have Boolean operators. In this

case, objects that match the property values that are not preceded by Boolean operators may or may not appear in the result set, but objects that match the terms without Boolean operators are sorted higher in the query results than objects that donâ€™t match those terms.

For example, this query expression finds objects that have custom metadata that contains both the terms quarterly report and accounting department or only the term quart erly report: customMetadataContent:(+"quarterly report" "accounting department")

Objects that contain both terms are sorted higher in the query results.

Value ranges

You can query based on ranges of values for properties with numeric, string, or date data types. These properties are accessTime, accessTimeString, changeTimeString, dpl, h ash, hashScheme, ingestTime, ingestTimeString, retention, retentionClass, retentionString, size, updateTime, updateTimeString, and utf8Name. You can also query based on ranges for content properties with numeric, string or date data types.

Criteria that query for a range of values can have either of these formats:

For a range that includes the start and end values: property:[start-valueTOend-value]

In this format, the square brackets are required.

For example, this query expression finds objects that were ingested from 0800 through 0900 UTC on March 1, 2012, inclusive:

ingestTimeString:[2012-03-01T08:00:00-0000 TO 2012-03-01T09:00:00-0000]

For a range that does not include the start or end values: property:{start-valueTOend-value}

In this format, the curly braces are required.

For example, this query expression finds objects that have names that occur alphabetically between Brown_Lee.xls and Green_Chris.xls, exclusive of those values: utf8Name:{Brown_Lee.xls TO Green_Chris.xls}

Note: utf8Name property values are case sensitive and are ordered according to the positions of characters in the UTF-8 character table.

You can mix square brackets and curly braces in an expression. For example, this query expression finds objects that were ingested from 0800 to 0900 UTC on March 1, 2012,

including objects that were ingested at 0800 but excluding objects that were ingested at 0900:

ingestTimeString:[2012-03-01T08:00:00-0000 TO 2012-03-01T09:00:00-0000}

When querying for a range of property values, you can precede the whole criterion with a Boolean operator but you cannot precede an individual value with a Boolean operator. For

example, the query expression on the first line is valid; the criterion on the second line is not:

Valid:+retentionString:[2013-07-01T00:00:00 TO 2013-07-31T00:00:00]

Invalid: retentionString:[+2013-07-01T00:00:00 TO 2013-07-31T00:00:00] When querying for a range of values, you can replace a value with an asterisk (*) to specify an unlimited range. For example, this query expression finds objects with a size equal to or greater than two thousand bytes:

size:[2000 TO *]

This query expression finds objects with change times before 9:00 AM, March 1, 2012 in the local time zone of the HCP system:

changeTimeString:[* TO 2012-03-01T09:00:00} Wildcard characters in property-based searches

You can use the question mark (?) and asterisk (*) wildcard characters when specifying values for these object properties:

customMetadataContent hash

hashScheme retentionClass

objectPath utf8Name

content properties
