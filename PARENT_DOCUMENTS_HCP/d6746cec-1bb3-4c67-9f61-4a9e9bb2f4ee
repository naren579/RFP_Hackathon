For an active/passive link, the value of this property is always zero. This value is also always zero for the default tenant.

objectsPending Long

For an active/active link, an outbound active/passive link during replication, or an inbound active/passive link during data recovery, specifies the approximate number of objects in the tenant's namespaces that are currently waiting to be replicated from the local system to the remote system for the replication link.

For an outbound link during data recovery or for an inbound link during replication, the value of this property is always zero. This value is also always zero for the default tenant. objectsPendingRemote Long

Specifies the approximate number of objects in the tenant's namespaces that are currently waiting to be replicated from the remote system for the replication link to the local system.

For an active/passive link, the value of this property is always zero. This value is also always zero for the default tenant. status

String

Specifies the status of activity for the tenant on the replication link. Possible values are:

AUTO_PAUSED

HCP automatically paused replication or recovery of the tenant.

PAUSED

A user paused replication or recovery of the tenant.

REPLICATING

Replication or recovery of the tenant is proceeding normally. upToDateAsOfMillis

Long

Specifies, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, the date and time before which configuration changes and changes to namespace content for all the replicating namespaces owned by the tenant are guaranteed to have been replicated from the local system to the remote system for the replication link.

upToDateAsOfString String

Specifies, as a datetime string, the date and time before which configuration changes and changes to namespace content for all the replicating namespaces owned by the tenant are guaranteed to have been replicated from the local system to the remote system for the replication link.

The datetime string has this format: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, hh is the hour on a 24-hour clock, and

Z represents the offset from UTC, in this format:

(+|-)hhmm

For example:

2017-03-18T10:47:59-0400

Example

Here’s an XML example of the tenant data type that describes the tenant-name resource for replication link content; the properties shown are those that are returned by a GET request for a tenant in an active/active link:

<tenant> <status>REPLICATING</status> <upToDateAsOfString>2017-03-19T17:45:15-0400</upToDateAsOfString> <upToDateAsOfMillis>1395265515303</upToDateAsOfMillis> <objectsPending>196</objectsPending> <bytesPending>46347338966</bytesPending> <objectsPendingRemote>14</objectsPendingRemote> <bytesPendingRemote>735856</bytesPendingRemote> </tenant> Query parameters for replication link content tenant actions

To perform actions on tenants in replication links, you use these query parameters:

pause

Pauses replication or recovery for the tenant on the replication link, as applicable.

resume

Resumes replication or recovery for the tenant on the replication link, as applicable.

You use these query parameters with a POST request against the replication link content tenant resource. You cannot include a request body with this request.

Here’s a sample POST request that pauses replication activity for the Finance tenant on the replication link named MA-CA: curl -k -iX POST -H "Authorization: HCP YWxscm9sZXM=:04EC9F614D89FF5C7126D32ACB448382" "https://admin.hcp-ma.example.com:9090/mapi/services/replication/links/ MA-CA/content/tenants/Finance?pause"
