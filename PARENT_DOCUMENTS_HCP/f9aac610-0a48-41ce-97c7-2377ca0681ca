c. To indicate the version of SNMP you want to use, select either Use version 1 or 2c or Use version 3.

SNMP version 1 does not support fields with the Counter64 data type. In the HCP MIB, several fields have that data type. When you use SNMP version 1 to retrieve

system information, it will not return values for those fields. d. To secure access to HCP through SNMP, for SNMP version 1 or 2c, type the name of a community in the Community field.

Community names can contain can be from 1 through 63 characters long and are case-sensitive.

e. To secure access to HCP through SNMP for SNMP version 3, in the New Password field, type a password to go with the system-supplied name in the Username field.

Passwords must be at least eight characters long and can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, including white space; however, the recommended usage is to limit the password to only ASCII characters. Passwords are-case sensitive.

If youâ€™re modifying the SNMP settings and you leave the New Password field empty, the previously set password remains in effect.

In the Confirm Password field, type the password again.

In the Community field, type a community access string. Community access strings can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-) and can be from 1 through 63 characters long. These strings are case-sensitive. f. To include log messages about compliance events with the messages sent to the specified SNMP managers, select Send compliance events. g. To include log messages about security events with the messages sent to the specified SNMP managers, select Send security events. h. In the Send log messages at this level or higher field, select the severity level of log messages to be sent to the specified SNMP managers: OFF

NOTICE

sends messages with a severity level of Notice, Warning, or Error.

WARNING
