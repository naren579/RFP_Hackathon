In query expressions, the values you specify for this property are case

sensitive.

version

Unsigned

The version ID of the object. All objects, including those in the default namespace, have version IDs.

version:83920048912257 long

This property is not returned for objects with the

NOT_FOUND operation type. For more information about this operation type, see the operation entry, above.

When you specify the version ID of an old version in a query

expression, HCP returns information about the current version of the object. content-property-name4

Depends on property type

The value of a content property.

doctor_name: "John Smith" Notes:

1. HCP maintains the time for this property as a value that includes millisecond, but the property format uses seconds. As a result, specifying a single datetime value for this

property in a query does not return all expected results. To retrieve all expected results, take one of these actions:

Specify a range of values for this property. Specify a value for the corresponding long-type object property. For example, instead of specifying ingestTimeString:2012-04-01T00:00:00, specify ingestTim e:1333238400.

2. You cannot specify a range of values for this property. 3. For object-based queries, you can specify this property only in the objectProperties entry. If you specify this property in either the sort or query entry, HCP returns a 400 (Bad Request) error.

4. You can use the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) wildcard characters when specifying values for this property. Query responses

This chapter describes the response format for both object-based queries and operation-based queries.

Note: In some situations, when you specify one or more namespaces in a query request, the result may differ depending on whether the query is object-based or operation-based.

XML response bodies

The format of an XML query response differs depending on the type of the query. XML reponse body for object-based queries

An XML response for an object-based query has this format:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?> <queryResult xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="/static/xsd/query-result-6.0.xsd">

<query> <expression>query-request-entry</expression> </query> <resultSet>

<object changeTimeMilliseconds="change-time-in-milliseconds.index"

version="version-id" urlName="object-url"

operation="operation-type" Additional properties if specified in the objectProperties request entry

or if the verbose request entry specifies true />
