                       <b>Title:</b> Retrieving annotations for objects and versions
You use the HTTP
GET method to retrieve an annotation for an object or version of an object. The annotation is returned in the format it had before it was stored.
You can also use a single request to retrieve object or version data and custom metadata together.
Access permission
To retrieve an annotation, you need read permission.
Request header
