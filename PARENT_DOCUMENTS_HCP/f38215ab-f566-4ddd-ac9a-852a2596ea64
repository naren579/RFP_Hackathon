Executing a POST object upload

When you execute a POST object upload, you specify a name for the object you're creating.

In the upload request, you can specify custom metadata to be added to the object when the upload is completed. To do this, you use the field x-amz-meta- within the post form.

In the upload request, you can specify an ACL to be added to the object when the upload is completed. To do this, you use the field acl within the post form.

If the ACL you specify in a request to execute an upload is invalid, HCP returns the status code 400 (Bad Request) or 501 (Not Implemented) and does not execute the upload.

When you complete an upload, you become the owner of the resulting object.
