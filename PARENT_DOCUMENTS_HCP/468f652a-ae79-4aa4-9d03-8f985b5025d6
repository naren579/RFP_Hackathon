Working with namespace contents

Listing directory contents

To list the contents of a directory in a namespace, click Content in the Namespace Browser menu bar and navigate to the directory you want. Each directory name is a link that lists the directory contents.

All directory listing pages, except the page that lists the top-level directories, have a parent directory icon ( the parent directory.

) in the upper left next to the directory path. Click this icon to display Directory listing

The directory listing displays information about the objects in a directory and provides access to subdirectories, symbolic links, and object versions.

The Namespace Browser displays up to 100 entries at a time. If a directory has more than 100 entries, you can use the Previous and Next buttons to page through the directory to see all its contents.

Click any column heading to sort the listing by the column values. Clicking a heading alternately sorts in ascending and descending order.

The list below describes the information shown for each item in the directory listing. Type icon

the object content or custom metadata contains a script that can be executed by that browser, that script is executed. If this is an issue for you, ask your tenant administrator about

having the display behavior changed.

Tip: You can use the view-source option in the web browser to see the XML for the Namespace Browser page.

Showing and hiding deleted objects and directories

If the namespace has versioning enabled, you can show or hide deleted items by clicking the link that says Show deleted objects (if deleted objects are not being shown) or Hide deleted objects (if they are being shown).
