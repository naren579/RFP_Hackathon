The reporting interval you select determines whether the report contains hourly, daily, or total statistics:

An hourly report contains one set of statistics for each hour in the report period for which statistics are available.

If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the first set of statistics in the report covers the time the system first came online through the end of the last minute in that hour. For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and the report period starts on July 25th, the first set of statistics in the report covers 2:30:20 p.m. through 2:59:59 p.m. on July 25th. If the report period ends on the current day, the last set of statistics in the report covers the time from the start of the current hour to the time when you requested the report. For example, if you request an hourly report at 2:30:15 p.m., the last set of statistics in the report covers 2:00:00 p.m. through 2:30:15 p.m. on the current day.

A daily report contains one set of statistics for each day in the report period, where a day is defined as the period from 12:00:00 a.m. through 11:59:59 p.m. on any given date.

If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the first set of statistics in the report covers the time the system first came online through the end of the last minute on that day. For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and the report period starts on July 25th, the first set of statistics in the report covers 2:30:20 p.m. through 11:59:59 p.m. on July 25th. If the report period ends on the current day, the last set of statistics in the report covers 12:00:00 a.m. on the current day to the time when you requested the report. For example, if you request a daily report at 2:30:15 p.m., the last set of statistics in the report covers 12:00:00 a.m. through 2:30:15 p.m. on the current day.

A total report contains one set of statistics for the entire report period.

If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the statistics in the report cover the time the system first came online either through 11:59:59 p.m. on the last day of the report period or through the time when you requested the report on the currrent day.

For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and, on August 7th, you request a total report with a start date of July 25th and an end date of August 7th, the statistics in the report cover 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th through 2:50:25 p.m. on August 7th. Statistics collected for the current hour may not include some reads and writes that have already occurred during the hour. After the hour is over, however, the statistics collected for it are complete.

Tip: You can use the HCP management API to generate chargeback reports that cover time periods that are longer than one month and are in XML, JSON, or CSV format. You can use this feature to create applications that generate chargeback reports at regular intervals and feed those reports to a billing system.
