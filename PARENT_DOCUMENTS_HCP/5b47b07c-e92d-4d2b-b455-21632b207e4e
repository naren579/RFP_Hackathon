Hitachi Content Platform is the distributed, fixed-content, data storage system from Hitachi Vantara. HCP provides a cost-effective, scalable, easy-to-use repository that can accommodate all types of data, from simple text files to medical images to multigigabyte database images.

A fixed-content storage system is one in which the data cannot be modified. HCP uses write-once, read-many (WORM) storage technology and a variety of policies and internal processes to ensure the integrity of the stored data and the efficient use of storage capacity. HCP also provides easy access to the repository for adding, retrieving, and deleting or shredding data. Object-based storage

HCP stores objects in a repository. Each object permanently associates data HCP receives (for example, a document, an image, or a movie) with information about that data, called metadata.

An object encapsulates:

Fixed-content data

An exact digital reproduction of data as it existed before it was stored in HCP. Once itâ€™s in the repository, this fixed-content data cannot be modified. System metadata

System-managed properties that describe the fixed-content data (for example, its size and creation date). System metadata includes policies, such as retention and data protection level, that influence how transactions and internal processes affect the object.

Custom metadata

Optional metadata that a user or application provides to further describe the object. Custom metadata is specified as one or more annotations, where each annotation is a discrete unit of information about the object. Annotations are typically specified in XML format. You can use custom metadata to create self-describing objects. Users and applications can use this metadata to understand and repurpose object content. Access control list (ACL)

Optional metadata consisting of a set of grants of permissions to perform various operations on the object. Permissions can be granted to individual users or to groups of users. ACLs are provided by users or applications and are specified in either XML or JSON format.

HCP can store multiple versions of an object, thus providing a history of how the data has changed over time. Each version is a separate object, with its own system metadata and, optionally, its own custom metadata and ACL.

HCP supports multipart uploads with the Hitachi API for Amazon S3. With a multipart upload, the data for an object is broken into multiple parts that are written to HCP independently of each other. Even though the data is written in multiple parts, the result of a multipart upload is a single object. An object for which the data is stored in multiple parts is called a multipart object.

Namespaces and tenants

An HCP repository is partitioned into namespaces. A namespace is a logical grouping of objects such that the objects in one namespace are not visible in any other namespace.

Content Platform System Management Help

Namespaces provide a mechanism for separating the data stored for different applications, business units, or customers. For example, you could have one namespace for accounts

receivable and another for accounts payable.

Namespaces also enable operations to work against selected subsets of objects. For example, you could perform a query that targets the accounts receivable and accounts payable

namespaces but not the employees namespace. Namespaces are owned and managed by administrative entities called tenants. A tenant typically corresponds to an organization, such as a company or a division or department within a company.

In addition to being owned by a tenant, each HCP namespace can have an owner that corresponds to an individual HCP user. The owner of a namespace automatically has permission to perform certain operations on that namespace.

Each tenant can own multiple namespaces. An HCP system can have a maximum of 1,000 locally defined tenants and 10,000 locally defined namespaces. The system configuration can limit the number of namespaces an individual tenant can own.

Note: Replication can cause an HCP system to have more than 1,000 tenants and 10,000 namespaces.

An HCP system has both system-level and tenant-level administrators: System-level administrators are concerned with monitoring the HCP system hardware and software, monitoring overall repository usage, configuring features that apply across the HCP system, and managing system-level users.
