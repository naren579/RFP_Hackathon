You cannot combine query parameters and form-encoded data in a single request.
Response header
This operation does not return any request-specific response headers.
Response body
Simply deleting an object has no request body.
Deleting a specific version of an object will get the contents of the requested version of the object.
Deleting a range of objects or multiple objects will include the following elements in the response body.<br>
