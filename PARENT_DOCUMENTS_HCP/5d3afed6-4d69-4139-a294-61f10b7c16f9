HCP is temporarily unable to handle the request, probably due to system overload, maintenance, or upgrade.

In the last two cases, try the request again, gradually increasing the delay between each successive attempt. If the error persists, please contact your tenant administrator.

If more information about the error is available, the response headers include the HCP- specific X-HCP-ErrorMessage header. REST API non-HTTP response headers

The headers returned by HCP in response to REST API requests are either standard HTTP response headers or HCP-specific response headers. The following table describes the HCP-specific response headers.

Header

Methods

Description

X-HCP-ACL

HEAD for an object, version, or ACLs

A true or false value indicating whether the object has an ACL. GET for objects and object versions

X-HCP-ChangeTimeMilliseconds

GET or HEAD for an object,

The change time for the object or annotation, in milliseconds since

version, or annotation

January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, followed by an integer thatâ€™s unique for the change time

X-HCP-ChangeTimeString

GET or HEAD for objects, object versions, and annotations

The change time for the object or annotation, in this format:

yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, Z represents the offset from UTC and is specified as:

Header

Methods

Description

X-HCP-ContentLength

GET with compressed transmission

The length of the returned data before HCP compressed it. X-HCP-CurrentStorageNode

HEAD for an object or object version

The IP address of a node on which object data is stored. You may get

better performance retrieving an object if you use this IP address in the GET request for the object instead of using a hostname in the

request URL.

This header is returned only if both of these are true:

HCP is configured to return the header.

HCP has determined that a GET request for the object is likely to have better performance if the request is targeted to the IP

address specified by the header. X-HCP-Custom-Metadata

GET or HEAD for an object or object version

A true or false value indicating whether the object has any annotations.

X-HCP-CustomMetadataAnnotations

GET or HEAD for an object or object version

A comma and space-separated list containing the names and sizes of

all object annotations. Each entry in the list consists of the annotation

name, a semicolon (;) and the annotation size in bytes, as in report_data;12908.

This header is returned only if X-HCP-Custom-Metadata is true. X-HCP-CustomMetadataContentType

GET or HEAD for an object or

version data and an annotation together

The custom metadata type, one of:

text/xml if HCP checked for well-formed XM L when the annotation was stored unknown otherwise

X-HCP-CustomMetadataFirst

GET for an object or version data

and an annotation together One of:

true if the custom metadata precedes the object data. false if the object data precedes the custom metadata.

X-HCP-CustomMetadataHash

PUT for object data and an annotation together

The cryptographic hash algorithm HCP uses and the cryptographic

hash value of the stored annotation, in this format: X-HCP-CustomMetadataHash: hash-algorithm hash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored

annotation is the same as the custom metadata you sent. To do this, compare this value with a hash value that you generate from the

original custom metadata.

X-HCP-DataContentType

GET for and object or version data and an annotation together

The Internet media type of the object, such as text/plain or image/ jpg. X-HCP-Domain

GET or HEAD for an object or version
