Garbage collection: Identifies and deletes hidden objects or parts marked for deletion by deleting objects and cleaning up transaction logs. It measures the number of objects deleted.

Protection: Ensures repository stability by maintaining a specified data redundancy level (DPL) for each object. It operates based on the active service schedule and specific events, tracking the number of objects serviced.

Scavenging: Ensures metadata integrity by verifying and repairing metadata. It operates per the active service schedule, measuring the number of objects serviced, including those with repaired or unrepaired metadata. Storage tiering: Moves copies of objects among defined storage tiers and manages object copies within each tier. It operates based on the active service schedule and tracks metrics related to object movement and storage tier adjustments. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of objectsMovedToCloud, objects MovedToMO, objectsMovedToTOU, objectsMovedToRU, objectsMovedToSDU, objectsEncryptionCompressionStateFixed, legacyObjectCompressionEncryptionStat eFixedInRemoteCloud, and legacyObjectCompressionEncryptionStateFixedInSnode.

HCP S Series balancing: Redistributes objects to achieve a balanced state by evaluating storage levels across nodes within a pool. It adheres to the active service schedule and measures the number of objects moved across S nodes for balancing. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of bytesExamined, and bytesServed.

Configuring email notification You can configure each email recipient to receive notification of only selected messages based on the message importance, severity, and type. Message severity levels are notice, warning, and error. Message types are general, security, and compliance. In all cases, HCP makes a best effort to send the applicable email in a timely manner.

Recipients are added to the blind carbon copy (bcc) list for each email, so the recipients of an email are not visible to one another. The To list remains empty.

You can configure the content of the email that HCP sends. For example, you could choose to have HCP send the full text, severity, and date and time, and node number for each log message. Or, if youâ€™re concerned about exposing system tenant and namespace information in what is by nature an insecure medium, you could format the email to say only that

a log message was recorded. HCP writes messages to the log about email that the email server fails to accept. The messages about failed email are not sent to email recipients.

You use the Email page in the System Management Console to enable and configure email notification.

To display the Email page, in the top-level menu of the System Management Console, select Monitoring > Email.

Note: To view the Email page, you need the monitor, administrator, security, or compliance role. To configure email notification and test the connection to the email server, you need the administrator or security role.
