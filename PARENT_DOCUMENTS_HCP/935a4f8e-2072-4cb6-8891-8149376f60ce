                       <b>Title:</b> The data type describes the property of the data type. The data type is used to generate chargeback chargebackData chargebackData chargebackReport chargebackReport
reports.
Most of the properties in the data type represent statistics that describe the usage of a given namespace or of all the namespaces owned by a given tenant. In a chargebackData
chargeback report, each set of these statistics applies to one namespace or tenant during a given reporting interval (for example, one hour or one day).
Chargeback statistics either reflect a point in time or are dynamic. Point-in-time statistics are measurements taken at the end of a reporting interval, such as the used storage
capacity for a namespace at the end of an hour. Dynamic statistics are measurements, such as the number of reads or writes to a namespace, that are accumulated over time.
HCP accumulates dynamic statistics on an hourly basis, starting at the beginning of each hour. So, for example, if the reporting interval is an hour, one statistic might represent the
number of successful writes to a namespace that occurred between 11:00:00 and 11:59:59. If the reporting interval is a day, each reported dynamic statistic is the sum of the hourly
values for the day, where the day starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:59:59.
Properties
The table below describes the properties included in the data type. When the output format for a resource is CSV, the properties included in chargebackData chargebackReport
the data type are ordered. This table lists the properties in the order in which they appear in a CSV response body. chargebackData<br>
