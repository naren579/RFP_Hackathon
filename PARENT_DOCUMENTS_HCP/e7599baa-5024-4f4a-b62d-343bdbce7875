Content Platform System Management Help
Prometheus or Alertmanager servers, it creates a system event to indicate that the server is unavailable. This situation could occur if the volume storing the metrics runs out of
space, forcing the Prometheus server to shutdown.
Prometheus collects performance metrics in the following categories:
Gateway metrics
Storage metrics
Node metrics
Replication metrics
Event metrics
Services metrics
After you upgrade to HCP v9.6 or later versions and enable Prometheus, all the collectors are enabled by default and HCP begins collecting performance metrics. However, if the
filesystem storing the Prometheus TSDB reaches or exceeds 95% of its total capacity, the filesystem will become read-only and Prometheus will stop collecting metrics until there is
sufficient disk space.
The following table describes the performance metrics collected by Prometheus.
Note: In the following table, the instance label refers to the node from where the HCP performance metrics is collected.<br>
