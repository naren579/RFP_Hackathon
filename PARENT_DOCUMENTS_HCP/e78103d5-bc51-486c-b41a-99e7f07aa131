Use case of a namespace, with SMTP enabled directly writing to HCP S Series Node, is no longer supported.

HCP v9.1

HCP-43818

Certain third-party tools and SDK solutions that connect to HCP through HTTPS may not support TLS v1.3. With the release of HCP 9.4, for example, one such tool was found to be the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Similarly, HCP Anywhere 4.5.4 does not yet support TLS 1.3. Therefore, setting HCP to TLS 1.3 minimum stops HCP-AW communications until HCP is changed back to use TLS 1.2 as maximum TLS level. A future release of HCP Anywhere is expected to add support for TLS 1.3; please refer to the appropriate release notes of HCP Anywhere for further information. Before turning on TLS 1.3 in HCP, make sure that the tools and SDKs used to connect to HCP through HTTPS connection do support TLS v1.3. HCP v9.4

HCP-45026

The version Id tag is missing from the results when trying to list all objects and their versions on a namespace where versioning is not enabled.

When upgrading to HCP 9.4 version or later from previous HCP versions that are configured with Active Directory (AD), the sAMAccountName attribute value of the HCP computer account does not comply with Microsoft requirements (that is, the attribute value is expected to end with $ symbol at the end; however, currently it is present at the beginning of the attribute value). The sAMAccountName attribute value does comply with Microsoft requirements on newly installed HCP 9.4 clusters. To comply with the Microsoft requirement on upgraded clusters, customers need to disconnect their HCP system from AD and then reconnect; this process will update the sAMAccountName attribute value to comply with the requirement.

The HCP G11 node power supply might trigger a false alarm, indicating Power supply Power Supplies has triggered an alarm; status: No redundancy. As a possible workaround, an upgrade of the BMC firmware supported by HCP G11 might resolve the issue.
