String

One or more comma-delimited annotation names. Annotation names

are case-sensitive.

custom Metadata Content

String

Custom metadata content.

This property can be used only in queries. It cannot be used in sort or objectProperties properties.

dpl

Integer

The DPL for the namespace that contains the object. gid3

Integer

The POSIX group ID.

hash4

String

The cryptographic hash algorithm used to compute the hash value of

the object, followed by a space and the hash value of the object.

In query expressions, the values you specify for both the hash

algorithm and the hash value are case sensitive. You need to use uppercase letters when specifying these values.

When using wildcard characters with this object property, instead of a

space, separate the hash algorithm and the hash value with a wildcard

character. In this case, do not enclose the value for this property in quotation marks.

If you do not specify wildcard characters in the value for this property,

you need to enclose the entire value for this property in double quotation marks. hashScheme4

String

The cryptographic hash algorithm the namespace uses.

In query expressions, the values you specify for this property are case

sensitive. Do not enclose these values in quotation marks.

hold2

Boolean

An indication of whether the object is currently on hold. Valid values

are: true

The object is on hold.

false

The object is not on hold.

index2

Boolean

An indication of which parts of the object are indexed. Valid values

are:

true

All metadata, including any custom metadata and ACL, is indexed.

false

Only system metadata and ACLs are indexed.

ingestTime

Long

The time at which HCP stored the object, in seconds since January 1,

1970, at 00:00:00 UTC. ingestTime String1

Datetime

The time at which HCP stored the object, in ISO 8601 format:

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ

For more information about this format, see the description of the acc essTimeString property.

Object property

Data type

Description

namespace2

String

The name of the namespace that contains the object, in this format: namespace-name.tenant-name

In query expressions, the values you specify for this property are not case sensitive.

objectPath4

String

The path to the object following rest, data, or fcfs_data, beginning with

a forward slash (/).

In query expressions, the values you specify for this property are not case sensitive and do not need to begin with a forward slash (/). operation3

String

The type of operation the result represents.

Possible values in a response body are:

CREATED

DELETED DISPOSED

PRUNED PURGED

NOT_FOUND

PRUNED and PURGED do not apply to objects in the default

namespace.

Results for object-based queries have either the CREATED or NOT_FOUND operation type. NOT_FOUND means that the object

has been deleted from the repository but has not yet been removed
