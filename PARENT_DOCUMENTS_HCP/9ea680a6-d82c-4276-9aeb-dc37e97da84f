                       <b>Title:</b> Object names and access through the CIFS and NFS protocols
The CIFS and NFS protocols cannot handle object or folder names that are longer than 255 bytes. An object stored through the S3 compatible API is inaccessible through CIFS and
NFS if:
The object name is longer than 255 bytes and does not include any forward slashes.
The object name includes one or more forward slashes and any part of the name is longer than 255 bytes. In this case, a part of an object name is any character string that
either precedes the first forward slash, comes between two forward slashes, or follows the last forward slash.
Percent-encoding special characters
With the S3 compatible API, object names are specified in URLs. Some characters have special meaning in URLs and may be interpreted incorrectly when used for other purposes.
To avoid ambiguity, percent-encode the special characters listed in the table below.<br>
