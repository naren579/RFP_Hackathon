The does and does not operators test for the existence of the specified content property. That is, does exist condition matches only objects with custom metadata that have the specified content property. One use for the does exist condition is to limit the scope of the is not and does not contain operators.

The is not and does not contain operators match all objects that don't have the content property value specified by the value field. As a result, the criterion matches objects without the content property, and even those with no custom metadata at all. To make sure that a query matches only objects with custom metadata identified by the content property, use two criteria for the content property, one with an is not or does not contain operator and one with a does operator with the exist value.

Specifying an owner With the Owner property, you can specify an owner using the Find Objects by Owner window or you can type a value. You can specify an owner only when the operator is is or is n ot.

1. Click the select owner control ( 2. In the Find Objects by Owner window, in the Tenant or Domain section, type the name of the tenant or AD domain in which the user account of the object owner is defined If you type an AD domain, precede it with an at sign (@).

3. In the in the Owner Name section:

To query for objects owned by a specified user, type the user name of the user account of the object owner. Values for the Owner property for structured queries use the same formats as values for the owner property for advanced queries.

To query for objects that have no owner, select Anonymous To query for objects that existed before the HCP system was upgraded from a pre-5.0 release and that have not subsequently had their owner changed, select nobody.

4. Click Submit.

On the Structured Query page, a value appears in the value field for the Owner property.

With the Grant property, you can specify an ACL grant using the Find Objects by Permissions window or you can type a value.

Values for the Grant property for structured queries use the same formats as values for the aclGrant property for advanced queries.
