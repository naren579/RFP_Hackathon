SNMP returns the incorrect replication link name

Workaround: Use the HCP Management API to return the correct replication link name.

— In rare circumstances, when HCP G11 operating system is installed on a node, the installation process may hang during making filesystems. This has typically been observed in SAN-attached configurations. This symptom occurs when HCP G11 detects that there appears to already be a filesystem on the volume, and the filesystem creation command is waiting for user input, but the prompt output by that command is not displayed on the console. If you are certain that the filesystem formatting procedure can continue (i.e., the volumes are mapped correctly, and all data on the volume can be destroyed), you can type in yes and press Enter, which should allow the procedure to continue.

Multipart upload fails in the FileOpenForWriteIndex.suspendAndSwap function and returns an Attempt to suspend and swap a multipart upload file handle error.
