Network administration

An HCP system can be configured to support virtual networking. Virtual networking enables the segregation of network traffic between clients and different HCP tenants, between management and data access functions, and between system-level and tenant-level traffic. This segregation enhances the privacy and security of communications over the HCP front-end network.

To implement virtual networking on a system that is configured to support it, you define one or more networks. You then configure the system to use specific networks for specific functions.

This help section assumes that you already have a solid understanding of network virtualization and experience with configuring physical and logical network components. HCP networks

HCP has two networks that are created during system installation: [hcp_system] and [hcp_backend]. The [hcp_system] network is used for front-end communication with the system. The [hcp_backend] network is used for communication between the nodes in the HCP system. Modifying the [hcp_system] and [hcp_backend] networks requires the service role and should be done only by authorized HCP service providers.

With certain HCP system hardware configurations, an [hcp_management] network is created during installation and can be enabled once the system is running. The [hcp_management] network needs to be enabled by a system administrator. The management network segregates system and tenant administration, management API, SNMP,

syslog, outgoing SMTP, and SSH traffic from the [hcp_system] network. IP modes
