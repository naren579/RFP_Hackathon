http_connections_limit

Maximum number of supported HTTP connections on an HCP node. Note: The http_connections_limit setting specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be made to a server. The number of connections can exceed instance

the HTTP connections limit. The queue size may not be limited, but it can grow.
