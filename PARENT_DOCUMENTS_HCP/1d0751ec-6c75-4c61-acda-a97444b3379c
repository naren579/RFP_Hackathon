Content Platform System Management Help
When generating a storage report, you need to specify what the report is for, the report period, and the reporting interval. A report can be for one or all components, pools, or service
plans or for all components, pools, and service plans.
To specify the report period, you select start and end dates. The report period starts at 12:00:00 a.m. on the start date (shown as 00:00:00) and ends at 11:59:59 p.m. on the end
date.
The earliest start date you can specify is either 30 days earlier than the current date or the date when the HCP system was installed (if the system was installed less than 30 days
ago). The latest end date you can specify is the current date.
You can use the same date as the start date and the end date for a report period. In this case, the report period starts at 12:00:00 a.m. on the specified date and ends at 11:59:59
p.m. on that date.
The reporting interval you select determines whether the report contains hourly, daily, or total statistics:
An hourly report contains one set of statistics for each hour in the report period for which statistics are available.
If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the first set of statistics in the report covers the time the system first came online through the end of
the last minute in that hour. For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and the report period starts on July 25th, the first set of statistics in the report
covers 2:30:20 p.m. through 2:59:59 p.m. on July 25th.
If the report period ends on the current day, the last set of statistics in the report covers the time from the start of the current hour to the time when you requested the report.
For example, if you request an hourly report at 2:30:15 p.m., the last set of statistics in the report covers 2:00:00 p.m. through 2:30:15 p.m. on the current day.
A daily report contains one set of statistics for each day in the report period, where a day is defined as the period from 12:00:00 a.m. through 11:59:59 p.m. on a given date.
If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the first set of statistics in the report covers the time the system first came online through the end of
the last minute on that day. For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and the report period starts on July 25th, the first set of statistics in the report
covers 2:30:20 p.m. through 11:59:59 p.m. on July 25th.
If the report period ends on the current day, the last set of statistics in the report covers 12:00:00 a.m. on the current day to the time when you requested the report. For
example, if you request a daily report at 2:30:15 p.m., the last set of statistics in the report covers 12:00:00 a.m. through 2:30:15 p.m. on the current day.
A total report contains one set of statistics for the entire report period.
If the report period starts on the day when the HCP system was installed, the statistics in the report cover the time the system first came online either through 11:59:59 p.m.
on the last day of the report period or through the time when you requested the report on the current day.
For example, if the system came online at 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th and, at 2:50:25 p.m. on August 7th, you request a total report with a start date of July 25th and an end
date of August 7th, the statistics in the report cover 2:30:20 p.m. on July 25th through 2:50:25 p.m. on August 7th.
Note: Statistics collected for the current hour may not include some reads and writes that have already occurred during the hour. After the hour is over, however, the statistics
collected for it are complete.
To generate a chargeback report, you need the monitor or administrator role.
1. In the top-level menu of the HCP System Management Console, click Storage.
2. On the left side of the Storage page, click Reports.
3. On the Reports page:
a. In the Report For field, select Component, Pool, Service Plan, or Everything to choose what you want to report on.
Then, in the field next to the Report For field, if you selected Component, Pool, or Service Plan, select the specific component, pool, or service plan you want, or
select All to report on all components, pools, or service plans.
b. In the Reporting Interval field, select Hour, Day, or Total to generate an hourly, daily, or total report.
c. In the Start Date field, take one of these actions to specify the start date for the report period:
Click the calendar icon (
) to display a calendar. In the calendar, use the arrows at the top to navigate to the month containing the date you want. Then click
the date.
Type the date in the text field in mm/dd/yyyy format.
d. In the End Date field, specify the end date for the report period by selecting the date from the calendar or typing the date in the field.
4. Click Download Report.
5. Select the option to open or save the report file.
By default, the name of the report file is report.csv.
