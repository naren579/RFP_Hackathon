Regardless of whether you access the System Management Console by specifying a domain name or a node IP address, the Console provides administrative capabilities for the entire system.

Using a hosts file

Typically, the HCP system is included as a subdomain in your DNS. If this is not the case, you can specify an IP address in the System Management Console URL, as described

above. Alternatively, you can specify the HCP system domain name in the URL and use a hosts file to define mappings of one or more node IP addresses to the domain name.

The location of the hosts file depends on the client operating system: On Windows, by default: c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

On Unix: /etc/hosts On Mac OS® X: /private/etc/host

Note: Every HCP system has a domain that’s associated with the [hcp_system] network. If HCP is not included in your DNS, this is a dummy domain with a name that follows the

conventions for well-formed DNS names. Hostname mappings

Each entry in a hosts file is a mapping of an IP address for a system to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for that system.

Each hosts file entry that you create for access to the HCP System Management Console must include:

A valid [hcp_system] network IP address for an HCP node

The FQDN used to access the HCP System Management Console, which consists of the prefix admin. followed by the HCP system domain name

For example, if the [hcp_system] network domain name is hcp‑ma.example.com and one of the HCP nodes has the IPv4 address 192.168.210.16 and the IPv6 address 2001:0db8::101 defined for that network, you could add either or both of these lines to the hosts file on the client: 192.168.210.16 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

2001:0db8::101 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

You can include comments in a hosts file either on separate lines or following a mapping on the same line. Each comment must start with a number sign (#). Blank lines are ignored.

Hostname mapping considerations

In the hosts file, you can map IP addresses for any number of nodes to a single domain name. The way a client uses multiple IP address mappings for a single domain name

depends on the client platform. For information about how your client handles hosts file entries that define multiple IP address mappings for a single domain name, see your client documentation.

If any of the HCP nodes listed in the hosts file are unavailable, timeouts may occur when you use a hosts file to access the System Management Console.

Sample hosts file

Here’s a sample hosts file that contains mappings for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses: 192.168.210.16 admin.hcp-ma.example.com 192.168.210.17 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

192.168.210.18 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

192.168.210.19 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

2001:0db8::101 admin.hcp-ma.example.com 2001:0db8::102 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

2001:0db8::103 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

2001:0db8::104 admin.hcp-ma.example.com

Logging in

Depending on the HCP system configuration, you can log in to the System Management Console with an HCP user account or a recognized AD user account. To log into the System Management Console:

1. Open a web browser.

2. In the address field, enter the URL for the System Management Console for your HCP system.

If you inadvertently use http instead of https in the URL, the browser returns an error. Enter the URL again, this time using https. One of these happens:

If all of these are true, you are automatically logged in to the System Management Console, and the Console Overview page appears:

You are currently logged in to Windows with a recognized AD user account.

HCP is configured to support AD.

Your web browser is configured to support single sign-on with AD.
