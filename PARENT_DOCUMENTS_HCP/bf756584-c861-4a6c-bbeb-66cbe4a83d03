The Grantee element must include this XML namespace specification:

xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

The Grantee element must also include one of these specifications of identifier type to indicate how the grantee is identified: xsi:type="CanonicalUser"

The grantee is identified by the ID and, optionally, the DisplayName element. If present, the DisplayName element is ignored.

xsi:type="Group"

The grantee is identified by the URI element.

xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"

The grantee is identified by the EmailAddress element. ID

Child of the Owner element or of the Grantee element when the identifier type is CanonicalUser. The value of the ID element can be the user ID of an HCP user account or, for object ACLs only, the SID of an AD user account. The ID element is required in the context of the Owner element and in the context of the Grantee element when the identifier type in the Grantee element is CanonicalUser. To learn the ID or SID for a user account, see your tenant administrator. Owner

Child of the AccessControlPolicy element and container for the owner identifier. The owner is identified by the ID and, optionally, DisplayName elements. The Owner element is optional in an ACL request body. If you omit it, the bucket or object owner does not change.

Permission

Removing an ACL

You can remove an ACL from a bucket or object by removing all grants from it. To do this by using headers, use the x-amz-acl header with the canned ACL named private, like this: x-amz-acl: private

To remove an ACL by using an ACL request body, omit all grants from the request the body, like this:
