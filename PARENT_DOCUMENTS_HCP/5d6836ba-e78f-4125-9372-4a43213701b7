                       <b>Title:</b> HCP supports Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting framework that collects, organizes, and stores performance metrics. When Prometheus is used with a
visualization tool like Grafana, data collected by Prometheus provides operational visibility into the performance of your HCP instance.
The Prometheus server runs on two storage nodes in the cluster: the node with highest IP address and the node with the second lowest IP address. By default, Prometheus retains
all the collected metrics in a time series database for 15 days.
For a list of the HCP metrics collected by Prometheus, see HCP performance metrics collected by Prometheus
Enabling and configuring Prometheus
Enabling Prometheus allows you to collect various HCP performance metrics. HCP exposes Prometheus metrics on TCP port 9094. Use this unauthenticated port to monitor system
performance without exposing sensitive data. To prevent user access, block the port on user data networks. HCP system blocks all POST requests to the unauthenticated port. You
can only send GET requests.
To enable Prometheus on HCP nodes, you need an administrator or security role.
1. From the System Management Console main menu, select Monitoring > Prometheus > Configuration .
2. To enable Prometheus, select the Enable Prometheus option.
3. In the Prometheus Settings pane, enter the configuration information. The following table describes the values that you can specify.<br>
