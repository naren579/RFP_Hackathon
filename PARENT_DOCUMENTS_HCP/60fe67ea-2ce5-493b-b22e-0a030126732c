Content Platform System Management Help

While versioning is enabled, you use the HTTP GET method to list the versions of an object. By default, the response body contains an XML listing that includes the current version and old versions that haven’t been pruned. It does not include versions that have been deleted. However, you can choose to include delete records in the list.

If versioning is disabled, even if it was enabled in the past, HCP returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error code in response to a request to list object versions. However, if versioning is then reenabled, HCP returns information about all old versions that have not been pruned. Access permission

To list object versions, you need browse permission.
