Starting with HCP v9.7, HCP enhances Prometheus metrics collection to include support for the metrics of the following services. Executing any of these services will increment the metrics based on the action performed.

All the following services tracks the count of these three common metrics: objectsExamined, objectsServiced, and objectsUnableToService. The following list summarizes each service, its description, and any additional service-specific metrics it collects.

Capacity balancing: Assesses the storage level for each node. If there's a significant disparity in storage levels across nodes, the service redistributes objects to achieve a more balanced state. It measures the number of objects moved across nodes for balancing. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of bytesMoved during these balancing operations. You must manually start this service. Compression: Compresses object data to optimize HCP storage space utilization. It adheres to the active service schedule and tracks metrics such as total bytes saved by compression, percentage of storage saved, and the number of objects or object parts compressed. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of objec tsCompressed, objectsDecompressed and objectEncryptionStateChanged.

Content verification: Detects and rectifies corrupted data and metadata discrepancies. It follows the active service schedule and measures the number of objects serviced, including those repaired or deemed irreparable. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of ObjectWithDeletedCustomMetadata.

Disposition: Hides expired object data and its metadata and marks them for deletion. By default, it's disabled at the system level and operates based on the active service schedule. Metrics include the number of expired objects marked for deletion. Duplicate elimination: Increases available storage space by merging data associated with identical objects. It runs according to the active service schedule and quantifies the number of duplicate objects or parts merged. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of bytesDupEliminated and duplicateFiles.

Garbage collection: Identifies and deletes hidden objects or parts marked for deletion by deleting objects and cleaning up transaction logs. It measures the number of objects deleted.

Protection: Ensures repository stability by maintaining a specified data redundancy level (DPL) for each object. It operates based on the active service schedule and specific events, tracking the number of objects serviced.

Scavenging: Ensures metadata integrity by verifying and repairing metadata. It operates per the active service schedule, measuring the number of objects serviced, including those with repaired or unrepaired metadata. Storage tiering: Moves copies of objects among defined storage tiers and manages object copies within each tier. It operates based on the active service schedule and tracks metrics related to object movement and storage tier adjustments. In addition to the three common metrics, it also tracks the count of objectsMovedToCloud, objects MovedToMO, objectsMovedToTOU, objectsMovedToRU, objectsMovedToSDU, objectsEncryptionCompressionStateFixed, legacyObjectCompressionEncryptionStat eFixedInRemoteCloud, and legacyObjectCompressionEncryptionStateFixedInSnode.
