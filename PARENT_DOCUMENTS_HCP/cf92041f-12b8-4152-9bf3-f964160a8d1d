The object was added through a protocol other than NFS and neither the UID nor the GID for the object has been changed.

The HCP product-specific owner of the object was changed. X-HCP-Hash

The cryptographic hash algorithm HCP uses, along with the cryptographic hash value stored for the object, in this format:

X-HCP-Hash: hash-algorithmhash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored data is the same as the data you sent. To perform the verification, compare this value with a hash value that you

generate from the original data.

The

X-HCP-Hash

header is not returned for multipart objects. X-HCP-Index

A true or false value indicating whether the object is marked for indexing.

X-HCP-IngestProtocol

The namespace access protocol through which the object was added to the namespace. Possible values are:

CIFS_NFS HTTP

SMTP WebDAV

If HCP cannot determine the protocol through which the object was added, this value is UNKNOWN. X-HCP-IngestTime

The time when HCP stored the object, in seconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC.

x-HCP-LabelRetentionHold

Specifies whether the object is on labeled hold. A Boolean value (true | false) is returned.

x-HCP-LabelRetentionHold-Labels

If the object is on labeled hold (X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold:true) and the user has privileged data access and read permissions on the object, this header is returned with a list of all labeled holds. Example

X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold-Labels: [{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-1","hold": true}, [{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-2","hold": true },[{"id":"UniqueLabelHold-3","hold": true }]

X-HCP-LastVersionId

The version ID of the last returned object version.

X-HCP-Owner

The user that owns the object.

This value is an empty string if the object has no owner. This value is nobody for objects that were stored by an authenticated user before the HCP system was upgraded from a release earlier than 5.0. These objects effectively have no owner. This value is a user account ID if HCP can no longer identify the object owner by username. For example, you would see a user account ID if the HCP user account has

been deleted. X-HCP-Replicated

A true or false value indicating whether the object, has been replicated. The value is true only if the current version of the object, its system metadata, annotations (if any), and ACL (if any) have been replicated.

HCP returns this header only if either of these conditions is true:

HCP is configured to return this header, and the request does not include the X-HCP-Get-Replicated header with a value of false. The request includes the X-HCP-Get-Replicated header with a value of true. X-HCP-ReplicationCollision

A true or false value indicating whether the object is flagged as a replication collision.

X-HCP-Retention

The end of the retention period for the object. Possible values are:

A time in seconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC

0

1 -2

X-HCP-RetentionClass

The name of the retention class to which the object belongs. This value is an empty string if the object is not in a retention class. X-HCP-RetentionHold

A true or false value indicating whether the object is on hold.

X-HCP-RetentionString

The end of the retention period for the object. Possible values are:

A date and time in this format:

yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, Z represents the offset from UTC and is specified as:

(+|-)hhmm
