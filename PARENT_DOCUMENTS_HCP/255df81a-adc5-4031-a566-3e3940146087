To retrieve all the properties for a resource, you need to append verbose=true to the resource URL. If you omit the verbose parameter, HCP uses the default value false. prettyprint

The prettyprint query parameter causes the XML or JSON returned in response to a GET request to be formatted for readability. For example, with the prettyprint parameter, the returned XML for a list of namespaces looks like this:

<namespaces> <name>Accounts-Payable</name> <name>Accounts-Receivable</name> </namespaces>

Without the prettyprint parameter, the returned XML looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><namespaces><name>Accounts-Payable</name><name>Accounts-Receivable</name></namespaces>

The prettyprint parameter increases the time it takes to process a request. Therefore, you should use it only for testing purposes and not in production applications. Request-specific query parameters

Some requests take query parameters that provide additional information to HCP about the operation you want to perform or that request a particular operation.

When the only action you’re requesting in a POST request for a resource other than a replication resource is specified by a query parameter, you need to provide an empty request body. With cURL, you specify this body as the argument for the -d option in the request:

Content Platform System Management Help

With a content type of XML, the argument is an empty root element for the resource being modified, enclosed in double quotation marks, like this:

-d "<root-element/>"

For example, here’s a request to change only the password for the user account with the username mwhite: curl -k -i -d "<userAccount/>" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -H "Authorization: HCP bGdyZWVu:a3b9c163f6c520407ff34cfdb83ca5c6" "https://finance.hcp.example.com:9090/mapi/tenants/finance/ userAccounts/mwhite?password=p4ssw0rd"

With a content type of JSON, the argument is an empty pair of curly braces enclosed in double quotation marks, like this:

d "{}" HCP product-specific response headers

For an HCP management API request, the HTTP response headers always include the HCP-specific X-HCP-SoftwareVersion header. The value of this header is the version number of the currently installed HCP software; for example:

X-HCP-SoftwareVersion: 9.0.0.2

If a management API request results in an error and additional information about the error is available, the HTTP response headers include the HCP-specific X-HCP-ErrorMessage header; for example:

X-HCP-ErrorMessage: 'password' parameter is required. Security-related response headers

For an HCP management API request, the HTTP response headers always include headers that address browser security concerns. These headers have fixed values. The table below describes these headers.
