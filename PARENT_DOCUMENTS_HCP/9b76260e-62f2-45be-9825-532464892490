Checking the existence of a bucket

You use the HTTP HEAD method to check the existence of a bucket. To successfully check the existence of a bucket, you need read permission for the bucket. If the bucket you specify in the HEAD request does not exist, HCP returns a 404 (Not Found) status code. If the bucket exists but you do not have read permission for it, HCP returns a 403 (Forbidden) status code.

Request line

Depending on whether the bucket name is included in the hostname in the S3 compatible request, a request to check the existence of a bucket has either of these formats:

With the bucket name included in the hostname: HEAD / HTTP/1.1

With the bucket name following the hostname:

HEAD /bucket-name HTTP/1.1

Required headers
