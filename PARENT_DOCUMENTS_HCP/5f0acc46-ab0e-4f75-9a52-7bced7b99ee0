Content Platform System Management Help

If you use form-encoded data, you need to percent-encode only ampersands (&) in the reason parameter. This prevents HCP from interpreting these characters as starting a new

URL query parameter.

You cannot combine query parameters and form-encoded data in a single request. Response header

This operation does not return any request-specific response headers.

Response body

Simply deleting an object has no request body.

Deleting a specific version of an object will get the contents of the requested version of the object.

Deleting a range of objects or multiple objects will include the following elements in the response body. Element

Child element

Status codes Code

Meaning

Description

200

OK

HCP successfully deleted the object. This code is also returned if the URL specified a directory and HCP deleted the directory.

400

Bad Request

The request specified a conditional header, such as If-Match.

If more information about the error is available, the HTTP response headers include the HCP-specific X-HC P-ErrorMessage header.

403 Forbidden

One of:

The Authorization header or hcp-ns-auth cookie specifies invalid credentials. The namespace requires client authentication, and the request does not have an Authorization header or hcp-ns-auth cookie. The object is under retention. The user doesn’t have permission to perform the requested operation.

The namespace does not exist. The access method (HTTP or HTTPS) is disabled.

If more information about the error is available, the response headers include the HCP-specific X-HCP-Err orMessage header.

404 Not Found

One of:

HCP could not find a directory, object, or version at the specified URL. The specified object or version does not exist, or the request specified the current version of an object that has been

deleted. Any component of the URL except for the last component in the path is a symbolic link to a directory.

409

Conflict

HCP could not delete the specified object because the object is currently being written to the namespace.

Example: Deleting an object

Here’s a sample HTTP DELETE request that deletes the object named

Q1_2012.ppt from the quarterly_rpts directory in the namespace.

Request with curl command line curl -k -iX DELETE

H "Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d" "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/rest/quarterly_rpts/Q1_2012.ppt"

Request in Python using PycURL

import pycurl curl = pycurl.Curl()

curl.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Authorization: HCP bXl1c2Vy:3f3c6784e97531774380db177774ac8d"]) curl.setopt(pycurl.URL, "https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/ \ rest/quarterly_rpts/Q1_2012.ppt")

curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0) curl.setopt(pycurl.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0)

curl.setopt(pycurl.CUSTOMREQUEST, "DELETE")

curl.perform()
