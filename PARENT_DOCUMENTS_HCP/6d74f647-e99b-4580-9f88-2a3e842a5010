The chargebackReport data type describes the chargebackReport resource for tenants and namespaces. You use this resource to generate chargeback reports for tenants and namespaces.

A chargeback report contains historical statistics about a tenant or namespace, broken out either by hour or by day. You can also generate chargeback reports that contain a single set of statistics for a given time period, such as a specific month.

Chargeback reports can serve as input to billing systems that need to determine charges for capacity and bandwidth usage at the tenant or namespace level. Because a chargeback report can cover a specified time period, you can create applications that generate these reports at regular intervals and feed those reports to your billing system. Tip: After a tenant or namespace is deleted, you can no longer generate chargeback reports for it. Therefore, to ensure that you donâ€™t lose usage statistics, you should take this fact into consideration when setting the regular interval at which to generate these reports.

Chargeback reports are also a good source of information for system analysis, enabling you to adjust storage and bandwidth allocations based on usage patterns.

Chargeback reports are available only for HCP tenants and namespaces. You cannot generate a chargeback report for the default tenant or namespace.

A chargeback report for a namespace contains statistics only for that namespace. A chargeback report for a tenant contains aggregated namespace statistics. For example, the number of read operations for a tenant during a given reporting interval is the total of the numbers of read operations that occurred in all the namespaces owned by that tenant during that reporting interval. You can use a system-level user account to request a tenant chargeback report regardless of whether the tenant has granted system-level users administrative access to itself. To generate a namespace chargeback report using a system-level user account, system-level users must have administrative access to the owning tenant.

When generating a chargeback report, you use query parameters on the resource URL in the GET request to specify the reporting interval and the time period you want the report to cover. HCP keeps chargeback statistics for 180 days. As a result, chargeback reports cannot report statistics from more that 180 days in the past.

Note: If you upgraded HCP less than 180 days ago from a release that does not support chargeback reports, the earliest available statistics are from the time the upgrade was completed.

The response to a chargebackReport GET request can be formatted as XML, JSON, or CSV. Query parameters

You use query parameters appended to the request URL to specify the time period and reporting interval for a chargeback report. These parameters are all optional. Default values are used for any you omit.

Notes

Time period start=start-time

Use the ISO 8601 format

With a reporting interval of hour or total, if you specify a start time that is not on an hour break,

If you specify both a start time and an end time, the start time must be earlier than the end time.
