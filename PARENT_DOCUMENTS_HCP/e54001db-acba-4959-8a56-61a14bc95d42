Content Platform System Management Help To view the Networks page, you need the monitor, administrator or service role. To create, modify, and delete user-defined networks and network aliases, you need the administrator

role. To modify the [hcp_system] or [hcp_backend] network, you need the service role.

1. Select Name from the drop-down list above the network list. 2. In the text field, type the text string that you want to use as a filter. This string can be up to 64 characters long, can contain any valid UTF-8 characters except commas (,), and is not case sensitive. White space is allowed. ).

When filtered by network IP mode, the list includes only those networks and network aliases that have the specified IP mode (IPv4, IPv6, or IPv4/IPv6).

Filtering the list by IP mode

To view the Networks page, you need the monitor, administrator or service role. To create, modify, and delete user-defined networks and network aliases, you need the administrator role. To modify the [hcp_system] or [hcp_backend] network, you need the service role.

1. Select IP Mode from the drop-down list above the network list.

2. In the text field, type the text string that corresponds to the IP mode that you want to use as a filter:

a. Type IPv4 to filter the list to show the networks and network aliases that are configured to use only IPv4 addresses.

b. Type IPv6 to filter the list to show the networks and network aliases that are configured to use only IPv6 addresses. c. Type IPv4/IPv6 to filter the list to show the networks and network aliases that are configured to use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

3. Click the find control ( ). About the Node View page

The Networks > Node View page lets you view and modify the IP address assignments for the nodes in the HCP system.

Note:

To view the Networks > Node View page, you need the administrator, service, or monitor role. To change the IP address assignments for user-defined networks, you need the administrator role. You cannot modify IP addresses for the [hcp_system] or [hcp_backend] networks on the Networks > Node View page

Understanding the node list

The Networks > Node View page contains a list of all nodes in the HCP system. For each node, the list shows: The node number (node ID).

The back-end IP address for the node. The node status, either OK or Unavailable. You can change the IP addresses for a node regardless of its status.

To view the network IP address assignments for an individual node, click the node number. In the list of networks that appears, the networks for which the node has IP addresses are listed first, in ascending order by network name. These are followed by the networks for which the node doesnâ€™t have IP addresses, also listed in ascending order by network name.

Managing the node list

By default, the nodes in the node list are listed 20 at a time in ascending order by node number. You can page through and sort the node list. The Networks > Node View page indicates which nodes are shown out of the total number of nodes in the current list. Paging

You can change the number of nodes displayed on each page of the node list shown on the Networks > Node View page. To do this, in the Items per page field, select the number of

nodes that you want to display on each page of the node list. The options are 10, 20, and 50.

To page forward or backward through the node list, click the next ( ) or back (

) control, respectively.

To view the Networks > Node View page, you need the administrator, service, or monitor role. To change the IP address assignments for user-defined networks, you need the

administrator role. You cannot modify IP addresses for the [hcp_system] or [hcp_backend] networks on the Networks > Node View page
