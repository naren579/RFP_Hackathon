Example: Storing an object

Here is a sample PUT request that stores an object named quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019.ppt in the finance bucket. In this example, the retention value of the object is set to five days past the time when the object was stored.

The example also shows the response headers HCP returns while versioning is enabled for the bucket and while versioning is disabled for the bucket. Request with s3curl command line

./s3curl.pl --id=lgreen --put=/quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019.ppt -- -k

"https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/quarterly_rpts/Q4_2019.ppt" -H "x-hcp-retention: A+5d"
