One of the systems involved in an active/active link
The primary system for an active/passive link
The replica for an active/passive link
This section of the Help describes the basic workflows for these scenarios.
System failure workflow with an active/active link
The table below outlines what happens when one of the systems involved in an active/active link fails, where the system that fails is system A and the system that remains healthy is
system B.<br>
