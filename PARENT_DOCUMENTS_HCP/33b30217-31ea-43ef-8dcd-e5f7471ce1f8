Note: The lists of supported hardware are subject to change without notice. For the most recent information on supported hardware, contact your HCP sales representative.

Supported servers

These servers are supported for HCP systems with internal storage:

■ HCP G11 (D52BQ-2U)

■ HCP G10 (D51B-2U)

These servers are supported for HCP SAN-attached systems with internal storage:

■ HCP G11 (D52BQ-2U)

■ HCP G10 (D51B-2U) Server memory

At least 32 GB of RAM per node is needed to use new software features introduced in HCP 9.x. An HCP system can be upgraded to version 9.x with a minimum of 12 GB of RAM per node, and receive the patches and bug fixes that come with the upgrade, but the system cannot use the new software features. Inadequate RAM causes performance degradation and can negatively affect system stability.

If you have less than 32 GB RAM per node and would like to upgrade to HCP 9.x, contact your Hitachi Vantara account team.

Recommendations for HCP back-end network switch configuration

If an HCP system is using customer-supplied and managed back-end network switches, as in the case for an HCP system hosted on VMware, and the back-end network configuration requires IGMP snooping, configure the back-end as follows:

■ Set the Querier’s IP address: The Querier’s IP address should be set to an IP

address within the subnet of the HCP back-end network. This is required for the Querier to detect and manage multicast group membership properly. Supported Fibre Channel switches

The following Fibre Channel switches are supported for HCP SAIN systems:

■ Brocade 5120
