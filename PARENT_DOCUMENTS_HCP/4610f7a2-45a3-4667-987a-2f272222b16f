hash value that you generate from the original annotation content. This header is returned only if the request contains both data and custom metadata. X-HCP-Hash

The cryptographic hash algorithm HCP uses, along with the cryptographic hash value stored for the object, in this format:

X-HCP-Hash: hash-algorithmhash-value

You can use the returned hash value to verify that the stored data is the same as the data you sent. To perform the verification, compare this value with a hash value that you generate from the original data. The

X-HCP-Hash

header is not returned for multipart objects.

X-HCP-VersionId

The version ID of the object.
