If the returned data is large, HCP might send a chunked response, which does not include this header. Content-Range

Returned only when getting partial content. The byte range of the returned object data, in this format:

start-positionâ€“end-position / object-size

where object-size is the total size of the object data and is the same as the value of the X-HCP-Size header.

Content-Type

The type of content for the object:

If you requested all or part of the object data only, this is the Internet media type of the object data, such as text/plain or image/jpg. If you requested the object data and an annotation together, this value is always application/octet-stream.

The ETag of the object or version enclosed in double quotation marks ("). This header is returned only if the object has an ETag.

X-HCP-ACL

A true or false value indicating whether the object has an ACL. X-HCP-ChangeTimeMilliseconds

The change time for the object, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC, followed by an integer that is unique for the change time. For example:

1336483100178.00. X-HCP-ChangeTimeString

The change time for the object in this format:

yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ

In this format, Z represents the offset from UTC and is specified as:

(+|-)hhmm

For example, 2020-09-18T09:18:20-0400 represents the start of the 20th second into 9:18 AM, September 18, 2020, EDT. X-HCP-ContentLength

The uncompressed length of the returned data. If the response returns object data only, this header and the X-HCP-Size header are equal. This header is returned only if HCP compresses the data before returning it.

X-HCP-Custom-Metadata

A true or false value indicating whether the object has any annotations. X-HCP-CustomMetadataAnnotations

A comma-and-space-separated list containing the names and sizes of all object annotations. Each entry in the list consists of the annotation name, a semicolon (;) and the annotation size in bytes. For example: report_data; 12908. This header is returned only if X-HCP-Custom-Metadata is true. X-HCP-CustomMetadataContentType

The annotation type, one of:

text/xml

If HCP checked for well-formed XML when the annotation was stored

unknown

otherwise

This header is returned only if the request asked for the object data and an annotation.

X-HCP-CustomMetadataFirst

One of:

true

The annotation precedes the object data. false

The object data precedes the annotation.

X-HCP-DataContentType

The object Internet media type, such as text/plain or image/jpg. This header is returned only if the request asked for the object data and an annotation.

X-HCP-Domain

The Active Directory domain that contains the user identified by the X-HCP-Owner header. This value is an empty string if the X-HCP-Owner header identifies a user account defined in HCP or if the object has no owner. If the X-HCP-Owner header returns a user account ID or nobody, the value of the X-HCP-Domain header is one of several invalid domains that begin with the percent sign (%). These values have meanings internal to the HCP system. X-HCP-DPL

The data protection level for the object.

X-HCP-GID

The POSIX group ID for the object.

For objects added through the NFS protocol, this value is determined by the NFS client. This value is an empty string if either of these conditions is true:
