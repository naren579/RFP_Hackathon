accessTime: [1312156800 TO 1312243200]

accessTime String1

Datetime

The value of the POSIX atime attribute for the object, in ISO 8601 format: accessTimeString: [2012-03-01

YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ

T00:00:00 TO 2012-03-01

Z represents the offset from UTC, in this format:

T23:59:59]

(+|-)hhmm

The UTC offset is optional. If you omit it, the time is in the zone of the

HCP system.

For example, 2011-11-16T14:27:20-0500 represents the 20th second into 2:27 PM, November 16, 2011, EST. acl2

Boolean

An indication of whether the object has an ACL. Valid values are:

acl:true

true

The object has an ACL.

false

The object does not have an ACL.

This value is always false for objects in the default namespace.

aclGrant

String

ACL content.

aclGrant:"Ww,USER, europe,rsilver"

This property can be used only in queries. It cannot be used in sort or objectProperties properties. changeTime Milliseconds

String

The time at which the object last changed. For delete, dispose, prune, changeTimeMilliseconds:

and purge records, this is the time when the operation was performed on the object.

[1311206400000.00 TO 1311292800000.00]

The value is the time in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, at

00:00:00 UTC, followed by a period and a two-digit suffix. The suffix

ensures that the change time values for versions of an object are unique.

This property is not returned for objects with the

NOT_FOUND operation type. For more information about this

operation type, see the description of the operation entry.

This property corresponds to the POSIX ctime attribute for the object.

changeTime String1

custom Metadata2

Boolean

An indication of whether the object has custom metadata. Valid values

are:

true

The object has custom

false

The object does not have custom metadata. custom Metadata Annotation

String

One or more comma-delimited annotation names. Annotation names

are case-sensitive.

custom Metadata Content

String

Custom metadata content.

This property can be used only in queries. It cannot be used in sort or objectProperties properties.

dpl

Integer

The DPL for the namespace that contains the object. gid3

Integer

The POSIX group ID.

hash4

String

The cryptographic hash algorithm used to compute the hash value of

the object, followed by a space and the hash value of the object.

In query expressions, the values you specify for both the hash

algorithm and the hash value are case sensitive. You need to use uppercase letters when specifying these values.

When using wildcard characters with this object property, instead of a

space, separate the hash algorithm and the hash value with a wildcard

character. In this case, do not enclose the value for this property in quotation marks.

If you do not specify wildcard characters in the value for this property,

you need to enclose the entire value for this property in double quotation marks. hashScheme4

String

The cryptographic hash algorithm the namespace uses.

In query expressions, the values you specify for this property are case
