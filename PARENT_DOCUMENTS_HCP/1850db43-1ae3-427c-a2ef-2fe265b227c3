Paged queries with operation-based requests

To use a paged query with operation-based query requests:

Optionally, specify a count entry in each request body. If you omit this entry, HCP returns ten thousand operation records per request. For each request after the first, specify a lastResult entry containing the values of the urlName, changeTimeMilliseconds, and version properties in the last record returned in response to the previous request. After each request, check the value of the code property of the status entry to determine whether the result set contains the last object that meets the criteria:

If the value is INCOMPLETE, more results remain. Request another page. If the value is COMPLETE, the result set includes the last object that meets the query criteria. Object properties

The table below describes the object properties that you can specify in these contexts:

objectProperties entry sort entry Query entry

In the sort and objectProperties entries, you specify only the object property name. In query expressions, you specify both the property name and one or more values for the property.

The properties listed below are also returned in response bodies. The verbose and objectProperties request entries determine which properties are returned. Object property
