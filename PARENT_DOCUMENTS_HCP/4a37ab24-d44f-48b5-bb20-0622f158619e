Deletion Allowed

The object can be deleted at any time.

1

Deletion Prohibited

The object cannot be deleted, except by a privileged delete, and the retention setting cannot be changed.

2

Initial Unspecified

The object does not yet have a retention setting. An object that has this value cannot be deleted, except by a privileged delete. You can change this retention setting to any other setting. An integer number of seconds

A datetime value

The object cannot be deleted, except by a privileged delete, until the specified date and time.

The format used for retention settings depends on whether you are specifying or retrieving a setting and on the protocol you are using.

Deleting an object under retention

If you have privileged permission and the bucket allows it, you can use the S3 compatible API to delete an object that is under retention. This action is called privileged delete.

You cannot use privileged delete operations to delete objects that are on hold, regardless of the retention settings of those objects.

Holding an object

If you have both write and privileged permissions, you can place an object on hold. An object on hold cannot be deleted, even by a privileged delete operation. Also, you cannot store new versions of an object on hold. Holding objects is particularly useful when the objects are needed for legal discovery. While an object is on hold, you cannot change its retention setting. If the bucket is configured to allow changes to custom metadata for objects under retention, you can also change its custom metadata.

If you have both write and privileged permissions, you can also release an object from hold. When an object is released, its previous retention setting is again in effect.

Holding an object using labeled holds

A labeled retention hold, or labeled hold, is a named retention hold that has a unique identifier. The ability to set multiple, independent labeled holds on an object enables multiple organizations or custodians to place a hold on the same object to prevent its deletion or versioning, or metadata modification, until all holds are explicitly released. This feature is supported by both the REST API and Hitachi API for Amazon S3. A common use of labeled holds is when an object is needed for legal discovery by multiple organizations or custodians. For example, there might be several lawsuits handled by different organizations within a company. The investigations or inquiries have different but overlapping time lines. A file relevant to all of the lawsuits must not be deleted when the first legal hold ends because the other lawsuits need the file as well.

A labeled hold can be placed on a new object at ingest time, or on an existing object in the namespace, provided the client application has write and privileged data access permissions. Similarly, the application can modify a labeled hold on an existing object.

To place a labeled hold on an object at ingest time, use the Hitachi API for Amazon S3 or REST API with the HTTP PUT object method and the X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold header. To add or remove a labeled hold on an existing object, use the S3 compatible API with the HTTP PUT object copy method and the X-HCP-LabelRetentionHold header, or the REST API HTTP PUT method with the query parameter method to add or remove system metadata.

An object can have both a single hold and one or more labeled holds at the same time. These hold settings are independent of one another. All holds must be released on the object before it can be deleted or have its metadata modified, regardless of the retention setting.

Prerequisite to set privileged data access and write permissions

Before an application can place a labeled hold on an object, the application must have write and privileged data access permissions for the associated namespace. Privileged permission can be set either programmatically by using the HCP Management API to update the dataAccessPermissions.xml file, or through the Tenant Management Console on the Users page of the Security menu.
