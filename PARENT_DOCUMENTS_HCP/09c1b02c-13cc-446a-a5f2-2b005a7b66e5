Content Platform System Management Help
Namespaces also enable operations to work against selected subsets of objects. For example, you could perform a query that targets the accounts receivable and accounts payable
namespaces but not the employees namespace.
Namespaces share the same underlying physical storage. This, together with the multitenancy feature described under "Tenants" below, enables HCP to provide support for cloud
storage services.
HCP and default namespaces
An HCP system can have a maximum of 10,000 locally defined namespaces, including one special namespace called the default namespace. Applications are typically written
against namespaces other than the default; these namespaces are called HCP namespaces. The default namespace is most often used with applications that existed before release
3.0 of HCP.
Note: Replication can cause an HCP system to have more than 10,000 namespaces.
The table below outlines the major differences between HCP namespaces and the default namespace.<br>
