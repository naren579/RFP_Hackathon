Starting with release HCP 8.2, all units of systemd- tmpfiles service log errors messages in /var/log/ messages on a daily periodicity. The error log messages are similar to the following:

systemd-tmpfiles[29354]: [/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ mdadm.conf:1] Line references path below legacy directory /var/run/, updating /var/run/mdadm → /run/ mdadm; please update the tmpfiles.d/ drop-in file accordingly.

Initial investigation suggests that these error messages cause no functional error symptoms in HCP.

— When provisioning rear-cage SSD to the HCP cluster on a subset of nodes in a SAN-attached G10 or G11 configuration, the service procedure tries to add rear- cage SSD on both nodes that comprise a Zero-Copy- Failover (ZCF) pair, even if one of those nodes does not have rear-cage SSD to be provisioned. This leads to error in the service procedure. As a work-around, ensure that you provision rear-cage SSDs either for both nodes that comprise a ZCF pair, or simultaneously for all nodes in the cluster.
