URLs for WebDAV access to a namespace

Depending on the method you’re using and what you want to do, the URL you specify can identify any of: The namespace as a whole A directory

An object A symbolic link

A metadirectory A metafile for an object

Note: To access a namespace through WebDAV directly from a Windows client, add the namespace as a network share, using any of the URL formats described in URL formats.

When you share the namespace in this way, it appears to be part of the local file system in Windows Explorer in the same way it does with CIFS access. URL formats

The following sections show the URL formats you can use to access a namespace. These formats all use a domain name to identify the HCP system. If the HCP system does not

support DNS, you can use the client hosts file to enable access to a namespace by hostname.

Note:

You need to use the domain name of the HCP system to access an HCP namespace through WebDAV. If you specify the IP address of a node in a URL, you access the

default namespace. The URL formats and examples that follow show https. Your tenant administrator can configure the namespace to not allow SSL security for the HTTP protocol. In this case, you need to specify http instead of https in your URLs. URL for the namespace as a whole

The URL that identifies a namespace as a whole has this format:

https://namespace-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name/webdav

For example:

https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/webdav

URLs for objects, directories, and symbolic links

To access an object, directory, or symbolic link in a namespace, you use a URL that includes the data directory. The format for this is: https://namespace-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name/webdav/data

[/directory-path[/object-name|symbolic-link-name]]

Here’s a sample URL that identifies a directory:

https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/webdav/data/Corporate/Employees

Here’s a sample URL that identifies an object:

https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/webdav/data/Corporate/Employees/2193_John_Doe

You cannot tell from a URL whether it represents an object, directory, or symbolic link. URLs for metafiles and metadirectories

To access a metafile or metadirectory, you use a URL that includes the metadata directory. The format for this is:

https://namespace-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name/webdav/

metadata/metadirectory-path[/metafile-name]

Here’s a sample URL that identifies a metadirectory: https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/webdav/metadata/Corporate/Employees/2193_John_Doe

Here’s a sample URL that identifies a metafile:

https://finance.europe.hcp.example.com/webdav/metadata/Corporate/Employees/2193_John_Doe/shred.txt

URL considerations

The following considerations apply to specifying URLs in WebDAV requests against a namespace. URL length
