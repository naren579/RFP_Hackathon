All S3 compatible requests must include either a Date header or an x-amz-date header. If a request includes both headers, HCP uses the date and time in the x-amz-date header. Host

Specifies the hostname for the request. The host name identifies either a tenant or a bucket. For a tenant, use this format:

tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

For a bucket, use this format:

bucket-name.tenant-name.hcp-domain-name

x-amz-date

Specifies the date and time at which the request is being made according to the requester. Normally, this is the current date and time. For the valid values for this header, see the description of the Date header above. Optional headers

Content-Type

Specifies the Internet media type of the request body. The only valid value is x-directory. This header is ignored if the folder name in the request ends with a forward slash (/) or the percent-encoded equivalent (%2F). Otherwise, this header is required.

Transfer-Encoding

Specifies the encoding transformation for the request body. The only valid value is chunked. Even if you include this header in the request, no request body is sent to HCP. Response headers

The list below describes the headers returned in response to a successful request to create a folder.

Content-length

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the response body. In response to a successful request to store an object, the value of this header is always 0 (zero).

Date

The date and time when HCP responded to the request, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The date and time are returned in this format: DDD dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss GMT

For example:

Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:27:05 GMT

ETag

Specifies the ETag for the folder. Even though a folder has no content, HCP returns an ETag for it. However, because folders have no content, all folders have the same ETag.

x-amz-version-id

Specifies the version ID of the object. This header is returned only while versioning is enabled for the bucket. Status codes

The table below describes HTTP status codes that can be returned in response to a request to create a folder.

OK

400

Bad Request

Possible reasons include that the request does not include a Content-Length header.

403 Forbidden

Possible reasons include:

The credentials provided with the request are invalid. You do not have permission to create folders in the specified bucket. The S3 compatible API is currently disabled for the specified bucket.

404

Not Found

The specified bucket does not exist.

409

Conflict

An object or folder with the specified name already exists.

500 Internal Server Error

An internal error occurred.

If this error persists, contact your tenant administrator.

503

Service Unavailable

HCP is temporarily unable to handle the request, probably due to system overload, maintenance, or upgrade. Try the request again, gradually increasing the delay between each successive attempt.

If this error persists, contact your tenant administrator.
