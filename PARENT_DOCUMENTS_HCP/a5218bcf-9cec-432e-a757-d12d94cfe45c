objectsPending Long

Specifies the approximate number of objects currently waiting to be replicated from the local system to the remote system for the replication link. This value is the sum of the numbers of objects waiting to be sent in each HCP namespace included in the link. This value does not include objects in the default namespace.

If the local system is the replica for an active/passive link, the value of this property during replication is zero. If the local system is the primary system for an active/passive link, the value of this property during data recovery is zero. objectsPendingRemote

Long

Specifies the approximate number of objects currently waiting to be replicated from the remote system for the replication link to the local system. This value is the sum of the numbers of objects waiting to be sent in each HCP namespace included in the link. This value does not include objects in the default namespace.

For an active/passive link, the value of this property is always zero.

objectsReplicated Long

Specifies the total number of objects replicated from the local system to the remote system for the replication link since the link was created.

objectsReplicatedAfterVerification Long

Specifies the number of objects replicated by the Replication Verification service.

objectsVerified

Long

Specifies the number of objects analyzed by the Replication Verification service. operationsPerSecond

Double

Specifies the current rate of operations on the replication link per second. An operation is the replication of any of these:

An object, directory, symbolic link, metadata change, or object deletion An HCP tenant or HCP namespace or the modification or deletion of an HCP tenant or HCP namespace For HCP tenants only, the creation, modification, or deletion of a user account

The creation, modification, or deletion of a retention class The creation, modification, or deletion of a content class A tenant log message

For an active/active link, the value of this property is the operation rate for replication from the local system to the remote system for the link. For an active/passive link, the value of this property is the operation rate during replication or recovery, whichever is happening at the time. In any case, the operation rate is cumulative for all the tenants being replicated or recovered on the link. upToDateAsOfMillis
