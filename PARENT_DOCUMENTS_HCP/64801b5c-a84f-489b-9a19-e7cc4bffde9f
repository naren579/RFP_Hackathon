      <td>In rare circumstances, when HCP G11 operating\nsystem is installed on a node, the installation process\nmay hang during making filesystems. This has\ntypically been observed in SAN-attached\nconfigurations. This symptom occurs when HCP G11\ndetects that there appears to already be a filesystem\non the volume, and the filesystem creation command\nis waiting for user input, but the prompt output by that\ncommand is not displayed on the console. If you are\ncertain that the filesystem formatting procedure can\ncontinue (i.e., the volumes are mapped correctly, and\nall data on the volume can be destroyed), you can\ntype in and press Enter, which should allow the yes\nprocedure to continue.</td>
