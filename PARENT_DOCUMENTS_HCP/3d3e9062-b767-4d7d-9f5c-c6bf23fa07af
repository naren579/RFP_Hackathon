                       <b>Title:</b> The values you specify in the From, Subject, and Body fields in the email template can include variables that correspond to the information available for each log message (for
example, the severity of the event that triggered the message or the short description of the event). When sending email, HCP replaces the variables in the email message with the
applicable information.
To include a variable in the email template, you specify the variable name preceded by the dollar sign ($). A dollar sign followed by anything other than a variable name is displayed
as a dollar sign in the email HCP sends.
The following table lists the variables you can use in the email template:<br>
                       <b>Bounding box:</b> x1=185, y1=1701, x2=1516, y2=2101
