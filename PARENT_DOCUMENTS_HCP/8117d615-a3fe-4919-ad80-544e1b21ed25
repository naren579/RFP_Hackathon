Working with ACLs

Storing an ACL

You use the HTTP PUT method to store or replace an ACL for an existing object. ACLs can be specified in XML or JSON format. Unlike storing annotations, you can store an ACL for an object under retention.

An ACL is stored as a single unit. You can add it or replace it in its entirely, but you cannot add to or change an existing ACL. If you store an ACL for an object that already has an

ACL, the new ACL replaces the existing ACL.

When you store an ACL for an object, the ACL is also stored for all old versions of that object.

You can use the HCP Search Console to modify ACLs on multiple objects with a single operation. Access permission

To store or replace an ACL for an object, you need write ACL permission.

Usage consideration

The PUT of an ACL may fail with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) error code if a large number of clients try to store ACLs for multiple objects at the same time. In this case, limit the number

of concurrent requests from clients to the namespace.

Bad Request One of:

The request is trying to store an ACL in a namespace for which ACLs are not enabled.

The ACL is not well-formed XML or JSON. The ACL includes an invalid entry or an invalid value for an entry.

The ACL does not include a required entry. The ACL specifies a user, group, or domain that doesn’t exist. The ACL specifies an AD user or group but doesn’t include the domain entry. The ACL specifies an AD user or group, but the namespace does not support Active Directory

authentication. Multiple name entries include the same user or group. A user or group can be specified in only one name entry in an ACL. The permissions you have specified in the ACL exceed your user permissions.
